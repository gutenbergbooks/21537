<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>The purpose of this volume is to show the action
and reaction of the most important social, economic,
political, and personal forces that have entered into
the make-up of the United States as a nation. The
primary assumption of the author is that the people
of this country did not compose a nation until after
the close of the Civil War in 1865. Of scarcely less
importance is the fact that the decisive motive behind
the different groups in Congress at every great
crisis of the period under discussion was sectional
advantage or even sectional aggrandizement. If Webster
ceased to be a particularist after 1824 and became
a nationalist before 1830, it was because the
interests of New England had undergone a similar
change; or, if Calhoun deserted about the same
time the cause of nationalism and became the most
ardent of sectionalists, it was also because the interests
of his constituents, the cotton and tobacco
planters of the South, had become identified with
particularism, that is, States rights.</p>

<p>And corollary to these assumptions is the further
fact that public men usually determine what line of
procedure is best for their constituents, or for what
are supposed to be the interests of those constituents,
and then seek for &ldquo;powers&rdquo; or clauses in State or
Federal Constitutions which justify the predetermined
course. This being, as a rule, true, the busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>ness
of the historian is to understand the influences
which led to the first, not the second, decision of
the Representative or Senator or President or even
Justice of the Supreme Court. Hence long-winded
speeches or tortuous decisions of courts have not
been studied so closely as the statistics of the cotton
or tobacco crops, the reports of manufacturers,
and the conditions of the frontier, which determined
more of the votes of members of Congress than the
most eloquent persuasion of great orators.</p>

<p>Thus the following pages utterly fail of their purpose
if they do not picture the background of congressional
and sectional conflicts during the period
from Andrew Jackson to Abraham Lincoln. But, to
be sure, in so brief a book all the contributing elements
of the growing national life cannot be fully
described or even be mentioned. Still, it is the hope
of the author that all the greater subjects have been
treated. What has been omitted was omitted in order
to devote more space to what seemed to be more important,
not in order to suppress what some may consider
to be of primary significance. Three hundred
short pages for the story of the great conflict which
raged from 1828 to 1865 do not offer much latitude
for explanations and diversions along the way. Nor
is it possible for any one to describe this conflict
satisfactorily even to all historians, to say nothing of
the participants who still live and entertain the most
positive and contradictory convictions. Hence one
must present one's own narrative and be content if
open-mindedness and honesty of purpose be acknowledged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>The book is intended for the maturer students in
American colleges and universities and for readers
who may be desirous of knowing why things happened
as they did as well as how they happened.
And by the employment of collateral readings suggested
in the short bibliographies at the close of
each chapter, both the college student and the more
general reader may find his way through the labyrinth
of conflicting opinion and opposing authorities
which make up the body of our written history.</p>

<p>To make this task easier some twenty-five maps
have been prepared and inserted at the appropriate
places in the text. These maps, perhaps one might
say photographs of social or economic conditions,
attempt to present the greater sectional and industrial
groups of &ldquo;interests&rdquo; which entered into the
common life of <i>ante-bellum</i> times. They treat party
evolution, economic development, and social antagonisms
in a way which, it seems to the author, should
help the reader to a better understanding of things
than would be possible by the simple narrative.</p>

<p>For permission to use the maps on pages 291,
313, and 327 the author expresses his thanks to the
publishers of <i>The Encyclopedia Americana</i>.</p>

<p>In this connection cordial thanks are extended to
Professor J. F. Jameson and Dr. C. O. Paullin, of
the Carnegie Institution of Washington, for the
privilege of using the data which they collected on
the election of 1828 and the vote in Congress on
the Tariff of 1832. Likewise Mr. P. L. Phillips,
of the Division of Maps of the Library of Congress,
has given the author much assistance. Nor must I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
fail to say that many of my students have rendered
practical aid in working out the details of several of
the maps. Mr. Edward J. Woodhouse, of Yale
University, very kindly read all the proof and prepared
the index. And Professors A. C. McLaughlin
and M. W. Jernegan, of the University of
Chicago; Allen Johnson, of Yale; Carl Becker, of
Kansas; and Frederic L. Paxson, of Wisconsin,
have all given counsel and criticism on certain
chapters which have been of great practical benefit.</p>

<p>But in making these acknowledgments for assistance
rendered, it is not intended to shift to other
shoulders any of the responsibility for statements or
manner of treatment which may arouse criticism.
The book is intended to be helpful, interpretative,
and beyond any sectional bias. If the author has
not been successful, it is not the fault of others, nor
because of any sparing of personal efforts.</p>

<h4>ANDREW JACKSON</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Let the people rule&rdquo;&mdash;such was the reply that
Andrew Jackson made to the coalition of Henry
Clay and John Quincy Adams which made the latter
President. And Andrew Jackson was an interesting
man in 1825. He was to be the leader of the
great party of the West which was forming for the
overthrow of the old political and social order. Born
in a cabin on the southern frontier in 1767 and
reared in the midst of poverty during the &ldquo;hard
times&rdquo; of the Revolution, Jackson had had little
opportunity to acquire the education and polish
which so distinguished the leaders of the old Jeffersonian
party. After a season of teaching school and
studying law in Salisbury, North Carolina, he emigrated,
in 1788, to Tennessee, where he soon became
a successful attorney, and a few years later a United
States Senator. But public life in Philadelphia
proved as unattractive as school-teaching had been;
he returned to the frontier life of his adopted State
and was speedily made a judge, and as such he sometimes
led <i>posses</i> to enforce his decrees. During the
second war with England he made a brilliant campaign
against the Creek Indians, who had sided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>

with the British, and gained the reputation of being
the mortal enemy of the aborigines, a reputation
which added greatly to his popularity in a community
which believed that the &ldquo;only good Indian
is a dead Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the close of the war, when most men were expecting
news that the British had conquered the
lower Mississippi Valley and that the Union was
breaking to pieces, he proved to be the one American
general who could &ldquo;whip the troops who had beaten
Napoleon.&rdquo; The battle of New Orleans made Jackson
an international character, and the West was
ready to crown him a hero and a savior of the nation.
Nor did his arbitrary conduct in the Seminole
War, or later, when he was Governor of Florida,
injure him in a region where Indians, Spaniards,
and Englishmen had few rights which an American
need respect. The attacks of Henry Clay in the
House of Representatives, and of William H. Crawford
in the Cabinet, were regarded as political maneuvers.
When, therefore, Jackson offered himself
in 1823 as a candidate for the Presidency, most
Western men welcomed him, fearing only that his
age and his delicate health, of which he had said too
much in public, might cut him off before he could
render his country the great service of which they
considered him capable. The politicians, especially
those who followed Henry Clay, did their utmost to
defeat him, and the votes of the West were divided
almost evenly between the two backwoods rivals.
But when it became clear in 1825 that Speaker
Clay of the House of Representatives had added his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
influence to that of John Quincy Adams in order to
prevent Jackson from winning, Western men everywhere
made his cause their cause. &ldquo;Let the people
rule&rdquo; became a battle-cry which was taken up in
every frontier State from Georgia to Illinois.</p>

<p>It was time that the people devoted more attention
to public affairs; they had in fact well-nigh
abdicated. In Virginia, with a white population of
625,000, only 15,000 had voted in the election of
1824; in Pennsylvania, whose population was over
a million, only some 47,000 had taken the trouble
to go to the polls; while in Massachusetts, where
the &ldquo;favorite son&rdquo; motive operated, just one man in
nineteen exercised the right of suffrage. Government
had become the business of &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; and
of those who made a specialty of politics. The old
Jeffersonian machine, organized as a popular protest
against aristocracy and the &ldquo;money power,&rdquo; had
itself become aristocratic, and it had ceased to represent
the democracy of the United States; and the
democracy had lost interest in its own affairs.</p>

<p>When Clay, the Westerner and long-time opponent
of Adams and the New England element in
politics, executed his surprising somersault in February,
1825, and thus made the eastern leader
President and then himself became Secretary of
State, occasion was given to a second Jefferson to
arouse the people to a sense of their responsibility.
Jackson, a very different man from the former man
of the people, seized the opportunity. Thus the
campaign of 1828 began in 1825, and in the course
of the bitter struggle which ensued men divided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
into social classes much as they had done in 1800.
The small farmers of the country districts and the
artisan classes in the towns of the East accepted
the leadership of the West and waged relentless
war on behalf of the &ldquo;old hero,&rdquo; as Jackson came
to be called. The Southern gentry who had followed
Crawford, the Calhoun men, and certain remnants
of ancient Federalism were now compelled to choose
between the so-called radicalism of the West and
John Quincy Adams, the Conservative. Two parties
thus took the place of the four Republican factions
which had contended for the control of the Government
and especially the offices in 1824.</p>

<p>But contemporary with this larger national conflict
there were important state and local struggles
on which the success of Jackson and the West depended,
and which we must survey and estimate,
else the real significance of the campaign of 1828 is
apt to be overlooked.</p>

<p>Beginning with the South, where Jackson's lieutenants
were expecting their greatest gains, South
Carolina was rent in twain by a conflict of social
and economic forces which was soon to overshadow
national issues. According to the constitutional bargain
of 1809, the low country and the black belt,
that is, the region of the historic river plantations
and the newer cotton country, were always to have
a majority in both houses of the legislature, which
chose the governor, the judges, and other important
officials. The reason of this was that the great majority
of the slaves were held in this section, and
without complete control of the Government the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
masters felt that their interests would be sacrificed
to the democracy of the up-country. The hill and
mountain region, on the other hand, had a large
majority of the white population. But by the arrangement
of 1809 the people of this section must
content themselves with remaining in the minority
in the state legislature, and suppress whatever of
opposition they felt toward the institution of slavery,
the cause of their effacement.</p>

<p>It was, however, this up-country which had been
the mainstay of the Jeffersonian party. Calhoun
was a son of this region, and he had grown up in
the midst of the bitterest opposition to the eastern
aristocracy. But gradually, under the influence of
cotton-growing, he and some of his fellows yielded
to the old order of the Pinckneys and the Butlers,
and the older order yielded a little to the democratic
group in the State. This produced the united
South Carolina which gave to the country Calhoun,
Lowndes, and Hayne, nationalists of the most ardent
type in 1816; and for a few years it seemed
that these astute leaders would play the r&ocirc;le of the
old Virginia dynasty.</p>

<p>But when Calhoun, with the aid of high protectionist
Pennsylvania, was bending all his energies,
in 1824, to winning the Presidency, there broke out
an insurgency in the former Federalist section of
his State which boded ill for the future. The burden
of its complaint was the national tariff, which bore
heavily on the cotton and rice planters. Between
1824 and 1828 the lower Carolinians developed a
vindictive hostility toward the leaders of nationalism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
in the State and especially toward Calhoun, who was
considered responsible for the oppressions of the
tariff. Robert Barnwell Rhett and William Smith,
two perfect representatives of aristocratic South
Carolina, led the fight. Senator Hayne was among
the first to yield; George McDuffie, an up-country
leader, next surrendered; finally most Southern members
of the National House of Representatives took
up the cry against the tariff and extreme nationalism.
Nothing was more certain in 1826 than that Calhoun
and his nationalist party would be driven to the wall.</p>

<p>Vice-President Calhoun had taken note of the
coming storm, and in 1827, when the woolens bill, a
highly protectionist measure, was before Congress,
a measure in which all the Middle States' interests
were greatly concerned, he took pains to have his
vote recorded against the bill. Thus he publicly announced
his change of heart. A year later he was
even more outspoken in his opposition to the famous
&ldquo;Tariff of Abominations.&rdquo; However, he had already
made an alliance with Jackson, whose attitude on the
tariff no one knew, and who was very popular with
the protectionists of Pennsylvania. It was clearly
understood that Jackson would serve only one term
as President and that Calhoun should succeed him.
The leaders of the older section of South Carolina,
urging secession, were now confronted with a peculiar
dilemma. A conference with Calhoun led in 1828
to a reversal of the secession movement, and culminated
in the proposition that South Carolina should
suspend the tariff law of the country and ask a referendum
of the various States on the subject. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

this failed, then secession was to be the remedy.
&ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; was the name which this referendum
soon acquired.</p>

<p>The attitude of South Carolina was that of every
other Southern State from Virginia to Mississippi,
and everywhere it was the older and more important
groups of counties which so bitterly opposed the
protective policy. In Virginia college boys met in
formal session and resolved to wear &ldquo;homespun&rdquo;
rather than submit to the &ldquo;yoke&rdquo; of the Northern
manufacturers; in North Carolina the legislature
declared the tariff law unconstitutional. At the commencement
of the University of Georgia the orator
of the occasion appeared in a suit of white cotton
cloth, while his valet wore the cast-off suit of shining
broadcloth. The &ldquo;Tariff of Abominations,&rdquo; passed
in 1828, was producing revolutionary results in all
the region where tobacco, cotton, and rice were grown,
and this was the governing section of the South.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this all; Georgia was still at the point
of making actual war upon the United States because
the President and Congress did not remove
the Creek and Cherokee Indians as rapidly as the
cotton planters desired. The Cherokees had declared
themselves a State within the boundaries of
Georgia, defied both local and national authority,
and applied to the United States Supreme Court
for recognition and support. The Government of
Georgia had formally spread her laws over the Indian
lands and imprisoned those who resisted her
sway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>This Indian problem which Jackson would have
to solve was of the utmost importance to all the
region from Georgia to northwestern Louisiana, for
in that region lived the ambitious and prosperous
cotton planters, who were bent on getting possession
of all the fertile lands of their section, and the
legislatures of Alabama and Mississippi followed
the example of Georgia in assuming jurisdiction
over all Indians within their boundaries. Jackson
entertained no tender scruples about dispossessing
the natives, a fact which was well known and widely
advertised. When, therefore, Crawford, who had
been very popular with the planters of all the South,
gave up his antagonism to the Tennessee candidate,
and joined with the friends of Calhoun, whom Crawford
hated only a little more than he had disliked
Jackson, there was no substantial resistance in any
of the States, from South Carolina to Louisiana.
The way was preparing for a united South and
West.</p>

<p>If the Crawford men of the lower South gave up
their hostility to Jackson and the extreme anti-nationalists
of South Carolina submitted once more
to &ldquo;Calhoun and Jackson,&rdquo; it was by no means certain
what the gentry of the eastern counties of North
Carolina would do. They had supported Crawford
in the last campaign, and there was neither Indian
nor land question to compel them to support the
Western candidate. Moreover, there was a bitter
struggle between the east and the west of North
Carolina which resembled very much the secession
movement in South Carolina. The eastern men owned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
most of the slaves and produced the large staple crops;
controlled the lawmaking and the other departments
of the State Government; and its leaders
were generally, if not always, the spokesmen of the
State in national affairs. This position and these
advantages were legacies of the constitution of 1776.
The fact that they were in the minority in point of
population served only to whet their appetites for
more power. On the other hand, the leaders of the
western section of the State had fought for twenty-five
years to reform the constitution and the laws, to
create new counties in order to secure proportionate
representation, and to expand the suffrage in order
that their majorities might be properly counted.</p>

<p>The bitterness of the two sections threatened to
result in civil war or at least a division of the State.
But the eastern men yielded and in 1835 a convention
met in Raleigh. The planters were in the
majority. They made concessions, however, in the
matter of representation and in the popular election
of the governors, which tended to reconcile the up-country
people. But the control of taxation, suffrage,
and representation remained securely in the hands
of the legislative majority of the low-country counties.
Slavery and the allied social system were henceforth
immune, and the distinctions, forms, and realities of
a growing aristocracy made steady encroachments
upon the life of the State until the outbreak of the
Civil War.</p>

<p>Contrary as it may seem to the ordinary political
interests of such men, the North Carolina gentry
accepted Jackson and the Western party in 1828,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and the State was almost a unit in support of the
more democratic element in the nation at the very
time it was at the point of breaking to pieces locally
because one section of the State was unwilling to
grant the other a fair chance in the common life.</p>

<p>Nor was it different in Virginia. There the small
counties of the east, with a minority of the white
population, controlled both houses of the assembly,
the governorship, the courts, and the majority of the
State's representatives in Congress. This advantage,
as in North Carolina, had been guaranteed by the
constitution of 1776. The motive for this one-sided
arrangement was the protection of slave property
which, it must be said, paid the larger share of the
taxes. In western Virginia, extending then to the
Ohio River, there was a teeming population whose
ablest leaders constantly resisted this system and
demanded their rights. As elsewhere in the West
the program was manhood suffrage, equal representation,
and the popular election of important state
officials.</p>

<p>After twenty-five years of agitation, a constitutional
convention met in Richmond in the autumn
of 1829. Reformers everywhere looked to this body
in the hope that something might be done to &ldquo;put
slavery in a way to final extinction.&rdquo; Madison, Monroe,
Chief Justice Marshall, and John Randolph were
members. All of these favored eastern Virginia and
defended the privileged minority. Thomas Jefferson
Randolph, grandson of Jefferson, Philip Doddridge,
and Alexander Campbell represented the western section
of the State and democracy. After months of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

debate which covered every subject in government,
and especially slavery and its possible abolition, the
convention decided, in the face of serious threats of
secession on the part of the up country, to grant to
the more populous section only a slight increase in
the number of representatives. The power of property
in government was once again confirmed, and so hopeless
was the outlook that prominent anti-slavery men
deserted their own cause and joined the other side
during the next decades.</p>

<p>It was not an easy thing for John Randolph,
and the other champions of the eastern Virginia oligarchy
to commit their cause to the democratic party
of the Mississippi Valley, whose leader was the &ldquo;lawless&rdquo;
Jackson. Yet this is what they did. Nowhere
outside of South Carolina was the influence of Calhoun
more effective than in Virginia, and it must
have been this which turned the balance in favor
of &ldquo;the General.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From northern Virginia, even from eastern Maryland,
to middle Georgia the case of democracy seemed
doomed. John Randolph had denounced it as a monstrous
&ldquo;tyranny of King Numbers&rdquo;; Judge Gaston,
one of the purest and best men of North Carolina,
declared that the cry, &ldquo;let the people rule,&rdquo; was fallacious,
and asked with great concern, &ldquo;What is then
to become of our system of checks and balances?&rdquo;

While the radical spokesmen of the South Carolina
aristocracy declared that they would never submit
to that &ldquo;dangerous principle of majority rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The growth of the cotton industry between 1800
and 1830 had done much to retard the growth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
democracy, so urgently advocated by Jefferson; while
the interests of the cotton planters and the fears of the
tobacco growers had served to &ldquo;swing the leaders&rdquo;
of the aristocratic South into the Jackson columns.
Though the price of raw cotton had declined from
forty-four cents per pound in the former year to ten
cents in the latter, the annual increase in the value
of the total output between 1820 and 1830 was
$1,000,000 and from 1830 to 1840 the value of this
staple crop increased from $29,000,000 to $63,000,000,
while all other items of the national export
amounted only to $50,000,000 per year. Cotton
was grown in a comparatively narrow belt of country
extending from lower North Carolina to the Red
River counties of Louisiana and Arkansas, with a
total population in 1830 of little more than 1,500,000
people, of whom 500,000 were negro slaves.
Yet their annual output was worth in 1830, $29,000,000
and in 1840, $63,000,000.</p>

<p>In the older South the tobacco crop was not appreciably
greater in 1830 than it had been in 1800,
though in the succeeding decade the value of the
annual harvest rose from $5,000,000 to $9,000,000,
and the manufacturing of tobacco became an important
industry in many localities. Rice culture was
at a standstill during these years, and sugar was
only making a beginning; but the total of these staples,
including cotton, reaches almost to two thirds
of the national exports. The annual <i>per capita</i> income
of the lower South ranged during the Jacksonian
era from thirty to forty dollars, while that of
the older Southern States like Virginia and Maryland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

was not half so great, and the average for the country
as a whole fell much below that of the South.
There was thus a marked contrast between the fortune
of the average Middle States man and that of the
cotton planters.</p>

<p>The result was an extraordinary movement southwestward,
especially from the older South and Kentucky,
where population was almost stationary during
a period of twenty years. In Virginia good lands
sold for less than the cost of the buildings on them.
Jefferson's home, Monticello, including two hundred
acres of land, sold at public auction in 1829 for
$2500. Each autumn saw thousands of masters with
their families and slaves take up the march over the
up-country road through Danville, Virginia, and
Charlotte, North Carolina, to Georgia and Alabama,
or over the mountains to the valley of Virginia,
whence they followed the great highland trough
southwestward to the Tennessee and Tombigbee Valleys.
The population of Alabama alone increased
from 300,000 in 1830 to 600,000 ten years later.
Unimproved lands in the cotton country sold at prices
ranging from $2 to $100 per acre, and plantations
spread rapidly over the better parts of the lower South.
Men could afford to give away or abandon their
homes in the old South in order to establish plantations
in the Gulf States, for in ten years thrifty
men became rich, as riches went in those days. The
cotton country was a magnet which drew upon the
Middle and Atlantic States for their best citizens
during a period of twenty years.</p>

<p>While the Jackson leadership &ldquo;captured&rdquo; both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the conservatives of Virginia and the Carolinas and
the radicals of the Gulf region, the cause of democracy
made great gains in the Middle States. Half
of Maryland favored Jackson, and strangely enough
the conservative half. Pennsylvania, the head and
front of popular government since the days of Benjamin
Franklin, gave every evidence of joining the
standard of Jackson early in the contest. New York
had held a constitutional convention in 1821 and
opened the way for universal suffrage and the popular
election of most state and county officers. So
radical had been the sweep of reform that Chancellor
Kent and other conservatives spent their energies
in protest and prophecy of dire results to come.
But it was probably the work of Van Buren, a
conservative &ldquo;boss&rdquo; of New York, and of Samuel
D. Ingham, a wealthy manufacturer of Pennsylvania
and an ally of Calhoun, that made sure the votes of
these great States; for men of the old Federalist
party and extreme protectionists of both New York
and Pennsylvania ranged themselves behind Jackson
and his Western democracy.</p>

<p>If we turn now to the chances of Clay and Adams,
we must look to a part of Maryland, to Delaware
and New Jersey evenly divided, it seems, between the
&ldquo;forward and the backward-looking&rdquo; men, and to
New England. Connecticut abandoned her State
Church in 1818 and extended the electoral franchise
to all who enrolled in the militia. Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine were border States and distinctly
Western in their ideals, though they were in no
way inclined to desert the New England leader. Mas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>sachusetts,
the great State of the East, held firmly to
her conservative moorings. In the constitutional convention
of 1820 the liberals had failed at every point.
Webster and Story had defeated the proposition for
abolishing the property qualification for membership
in the State Senate; and the more radical plan for
overthrowing the established Congregational Church,
the bulwark of steady habits in Massachusetts, was
similarly voted down. Webster, like Randolph, of
Virginia, and Rhett, of South Carolina, urged that
property should rule in every well-ordered community,
and what Webster, Randolph, and Rhett urged,
their respective States adopted. Even more reactionary
was little Rhode Island, where privilege and inequality
were as firmly intrenched as anywhere else
in the country. The suffrage was limited to freeholders
and representation was denied the majority
of the people. The control of governor, legislature,
and courts was in the hands of the minority. In
1821, 1822, and 1824 leaders of the majority endeavored
to secure reforms, but without success.</p>

<p>From Augusta, Maine, to Baltimore stretched the
long strip of country which could be relied on to vote
for John Quincy Adams and to sustain conservative
ideals in government. Western New York was also
inclined to Adams, and Clay was confident that he
could carry Ohio and Kentucky, the conservative
communities of the West, for his ally. In the main
the men who supported the Administration were
those who feared the rough ways of plain men, the
ideals of equality and popular initiative so dear to
the American heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The managers of Jackson's campaign were members
of the United States Senate. Calhoun sat in the
Vice-President's chair; Van Buren was the leader of
the Middle States group of the opposition; John
Randolph was there and ever ready to turn his wonderful
gifts of ridicule and sarcasm against the Puritan
who sat in the &ldquo;Mansion&rdquo; and &ldquo;wasted the money
of the people&rdquo;; Nathaniel Macon, one of the most
popular of all the Senators, opposed the second Adams
as earnestly as he had fought the first; George Poindexter,
of Mississippi, was one of the most powerful
politicians of the cotton kingdom, and he showed a
never-failing hostility to &ldquo;Clay and his President&rdquo;;
but Thomas H. Benton, of Missouri, was the most
effective, perhaps, of all these men who were bent on
the overthrow of Adams and Clay.</p>

<p>They kept the &ldquo;bargain and sale&rdquo; charge alive
till the very day of the election. Benton urged on
every possible occasion the adoption of constitutional
amendments forbidding the President to appoint
members of Congress to office, restricting the presidential
term to four years without possibility of re&euml;lection,
and limiting the powers and jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court. He also kept the Western squatters
on the public lands closely attached to him by
promising that if he ever came to power their rights
to the farms they had taken without leave should be
confirmed by law. Nor did he forget to denounce
Adams for &ldquo;wantonly giving away Texas&rdquo; in the
negotiations with Spain in 1819. Every movement
of the Government was combated at every point
and defeated if possible. Van Buren, Calhoun, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Benton were an able trio, and they resorted for
four years to every possible device to discredit
the President and his Secretary of State and at
the same time to secure the election of Andrew
Jackson.</p>

<p>Duff Green, of Missouri, was brought to Washington
to establish and edit <i>The Telegraph</i>, the
organ of the opposition which began operations in
1826. It gave currency to the campaign literature
and educated the people in the cause of the West.
Adams was an aristocrat; he lived sumptuously
every day at the public expense; he did not associate
with the people; and he aped the courts of
Europe, where he had spent so much of his life. The
people of the South and West reached the point
where they could believe anything against John
Quincy Adams. No other President of the United
States has ever been so shamefully treated, save one,
and that one was Martin Van Buren, the man who
was leading the onslaughts of 1828.</p>

<p>Adams and Clay were helpless; it was difficult
for them to secure popular allies or get a fair hearing.
Richard Rush, the son of the Jeffersonian
radical of 1800, was made candidate for the Vice-Presidency
in the hope of winning Pennsylvania;
Clay did his utmost to stem the tide in the West;
Daniel Webster was, of course, on the side of
Adams; William Wirt and James Barbour stood
up bravely in Virginia for a doomed cause. But these
earnest and patriotic men could not rally the normal
strength of the conservatives, for the Southern
planters had accepted Jackson and the Middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
States conservatives were demoralized by the Van
Buren and Ingham activity.</p>

<p>The rough backwoods General had proved a
politician too astute for the oldest heads. He had
been able to enlist the services of Northern men who
did not believe in democracy, and he had the loyal
support of Southern leaders who were just then
breaking down the power of democracy in all the
older States of their section. He was not less fortunate
in the expression of his opinions on public questions.
On the tariff, the burning question of the time, he
had no views; on internal improvements he had even
less to say. Even on the subject of the free distribution
of the public lands he was silent, though most
Westerners took his hostility to the Indians to mean
that he would do what was desired. Jackson was
&ldquo;all things to all men&rdquo; in 1828, and this discreet
attitude seems to have been effective, though it was
to bring trouble when he became President.</p>

<p>When the vote was counted, it was found that the
people had been aroused as they had not been before
since 1800. The cry, &ldquo;Shall the people rule?&rdquo; was
answered by Pennsylvania by a vote for Jackson of
100,000 as against 50,000 for Adams. Virginia gave
Jackson as many votes in 1828 as had been cast for
all parties in 1824. And the total vote of the country
for Jackson was 647,276 as against 508,064 for
Adams. The General had won every electoral vote
of the South and the West; and both Pennsylvania
and New York had sustained him. New England
was solid for her candidate, and New Jersey, Delaware,
and Maryland returned Adams majorities.
The lines were drawn, as had been foreseen, just as
in the contest between Jefferson and John Adams
twenty-eight years before; and in general the attitudes
of the social classes were the same.</p>

The second alliance of South and West had been
effected, and &ldquo;the people&rdquo; had come to power a
second time, only the West was now the dominant
element. How would the West and &ldquo;the people&rdquo;
use their power?</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>J. S. Bassett's <i>Life of Andrew Jackson</i> (1911) is the best work on
that subject, though James Parton's <i>Life of Jackson</i> (ed. of 1887)
is still the best for a documentary account. The biographies of
Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams in the <i>American Statesmen</i>
series are the best for these men. Of more importance for a view
of social and political conditions of the South and the East are: the
<i>Debates</i> of the constitutional conventions of Massachusetts (1820),
New York (1821), Virginia (1829), and North Carolina (1835),
and <i>The Memoir of John Quincy Adams</i>, in twelve large volumes,
which covers minutely the period of 1825 to 1848. This work
appeared in 1874-76. It is a remarkable record of a remarkable
man. J. B. McMaster's <i>History of the United States</i> (1900-13) is a
life of the people which no library can afford to be without, and J.
Schouler's <i>History of the United States under the Constitution</i> (revised
ed. 1894-99) is equally good, giving a fuller account of the
political and constitutional development of the country. A. B.
Hart's <i>The American Nation</i> (1904-08) is a fuller co&ouml;perative work
by the leading scholars of the United States. The volumes which
bear upon the period in hand will be cited in succeeding chapters.
Special studies of importance are: C. H. Ambler's <i>Sectionalism in
Virginia</i> (1910); D. F. Houston's <i>Critical Study of Nullification in
South Carolina</i> (1896); W. A. Schaper's <i>Sectionalism in South Carolina</i>

(1900); and H. M. Wagstaff's <i>States Rights and Political

<h4>THE WEST</h4>

<p>Tens of thousands of eager people witnessed the
inauguration of Andrew Jackson on March 4, 1829;
they crowded the streets, stood upon the house-tops,
and peered out from every open window; they jostled
the attendants at the White House and overturned
the bowls and jars which contained the ices and
wines intended for the entertainment of the new
President and his friends. &ldquo;The people have come
to power,&rdquo; said a chastened admirer of Henry Clay
as she watched sadly the wreckage of the dainties
which dainty hands had prepared, and as she looked
with dismay upon the wearers of rough and dirty
boots striding over costly carpets where hitherto
only gentlemen and ladies had trod. It was a happy
occasion to the unthinking but honest democrats<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
who gloried in the success of their &ldquo;hero,&rdquo; but a
sad warning to the more refined who had been accustomed
to see things done in due form and stateliness.</p>

<p>But neither the uninformed masses who looked on
with delight that bright day nor the cultured people
whose hearts sank within them as they saw the old
order pass away recked aught of what was to come
during the next four years. Possibly the old man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
whom everybody called &ldquo;the General,&rdquo; and who
many feared could not live out his term, or the
solemn-visaged Vice-President, who had been filling
half the cabinet positions with his own partisans,
saw dimly what was to follow these joyous opening
days of a new r&eacute;gime, for he knew how unstable was
the base upon which the new structure rested.</p>

<p>The people who composed this new r&eacute;gime, the
men who voted for Andrew Jackson and who shouted
at and derided sturdy John Quincy Adams as he
retired from the Presidency that 4th of March, were
the rank and file of the United States. But the nucleus
of the party of Jackson was the West. In the
region which extends from Georgia to the Sabine,
save in New Orleans alone, no name equaled that of
the man who had driven the Indians like chaff before
the wind at the battle of Horseshoe Bend, and who
a year later had defeated the regiments of Great
Britain near New Orleans. &ldquo;The General&rdquo; was
known and admired all over the great valley of the
Mississippi as the friend of the people, while John
Quincy Adams had resisted the demands of the
frontier and had actually sent a regiment of the
United States Army into Georgia to defeat the purposes
of a popular governor, who was driving the
hated Indians from coveted cotton lands. Jackson
met, therefore, with little or no opposition in this
region, and the Southwestern politicians who had
fought for Adams and Clay in the campaign of
1828 had signed their political death-warrants.</p>

<p>In the older West, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri,
and Ohio, Henry Clay had been the natural leader;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and until about 1820, when he had championed the
cause of the National Bank as against local interests
and local banks, he had been the most popular man
west of the Alleghanies. From the beginning of the
Adams Administration he had lost steadily till in
1828 he tasted for the first time the gall of political
defeat. In these older Western communities it was
still a reproach to a public man to ally himself with
New England and the United States Bank, though
he might favor the protective tariff, and he must
support internal improvements. In addition to supporting
John Quincy Adams after 1825, Clay led a
&ldquo;fast and extravagant&rdquo; life in Washington, which
only added to his unpopularity in the West. In
1831 it was with much difficulty, and after a close
contest with Richard M. Johnson, that he was returned
to the United States Senate. General Jackson
had completely won the leadership of the Clay
territory and the affections of the plain farmers.</p>

<p>In the Northwest there were other large areas of
fertile lands in the possession of the hated Indians,
and there, as in the Southwest, the most popular
leader was he who believed and taught that the
quickest way to build up the country was to take
immediate possession of these lands. In Michigan,
Indiana, and Illinois the small farmers and the pioneers
were almost as enthusiastic followers of Jackson
as were their economic kinsmen of the Gulf region.</p>

<p>With these backwoods States thus devoted to the
man to whom Chief Justice Marshall had sorrowfully
administered the oath of office, it was easy for
the leaders of the new r&eacute;gime to make strong appeal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to the mountain counties of the Middle States and
South, whose political idol had been Thomas Jefferson
and whose people were only a generation removed
from the pioneer stage of development. With
the exception of some of the New England <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>
of western New York, the peasant proprietors of all
the up-country counties of the Middle States gave
Jackson their allegiance; while south of Maryland,
except in a few counties of western Virginia, almost
every man in the hill country was a stanch defender
of the first Western President. Thus in the West
and in the interior of the States which bordered
upon the Alleghany Mountains, Jackson had a great
compact following which for years to come was to
give him the advantage over all his opponents.</p>

<p>The radical and enthusiastic wing of the new party
was the Southwest, closely followed by the Northwest;
the older West and the up-country of the
Middle States and South composed the &ldquo;solid&rdquo; element;
while the low-country men, the planters of
Virginia and the Carolinas, regarded askance the
democratic leader whom they had reluctantly helped
to the Presidency. Of real organization and party
discipline there was little, and the beliefs and principles
of the various groups of the party were sometimes
antagonistic. On one thing only were most of
these men united: on the necessity of keeping New
England out of the control of the Government.
Surely any one who knew the actual conditions of
1829, the ambitions and the smouldering animosities
of the Jackson lieutenants, must have faced the
future with more than ordinary doubt and anxiety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But the people who shouted at the inauguration
and who had voted &ldquo;the ticket&rdquo; the preceding
November did not know the feelings of their leaders.
They thought that this country was a democracy
and that a majority of the electorate was
entitled to rule. Their ideals were those of the
Declaration of Independence, which were not very
popular in New England, and which were just then
being repudiated in the planter sections of the South.
They lived the lives of simple farmers and daily
practiced the doctrine of social equality, and hence
they could not understand why others should not do
the same, or why there should be anything difficult
or complex in the work of the incoming President.</p>

<p>In all the Western States almost every office was
filled by popular election. Legislatures met annually
and unpopular men or measures could be
promptly recalled, to employ a modern term. Even
the judges of the courts were subject to frequent
election and were quite attentive to popular opinion;
while United States Senators must canvass for votes
in ardent campaigns which strongly resembled the
primary contests of the South and West to-day.
But this democracy of the larger section of the
country which supported Jackson was counterbalanced
by the prestige and experience of its allies of
the South, where, by reason of the three-fifths rule
of representation for the slaves, which gave the master
of slaves a privileged position, and of long political
habit, a few planters exercised power out of all
proportion to their numbers.</p>

<p>Still the history of the country after 1812 indi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>cated
that the Western voters and not the Eastern
leaders would control the Government while Jackson
was President. These voters were nationalists
and their position made them look to the Federal
Government for better roads and improved markets;
they were expansionists who not only coveted
the lands of the Indians, but wanted also to seize
the territory of their neighbors. They were already
taking possession of Texas, and Thomas H. Benton
and Lewis Cass, of Michigan, their most popular
leaders after Jackson, were already the exponents
of an early imperialism which would never rest until
the shores of the Pacific became the western frontier
of the United States. In every State that bordered
on the Mississippi this sentiment was ardent, and
many good men were ready to make war upon Mexico
for Texas or upon England for Oregon, whose boundaries
no one knew and whose title had been held
jointly by the United States and Great Britain
since 1818.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Western men occupied a peculiar
position in the country because of the fact that a
large number of them had bought their lands from
the Federal Government on easy terms, at two dollars
or even a dollar and a quarter an acre, and were
still in debt for them to the Government or the banks
or other creditors. This indebtedness still further
stimulated their restlessness of character. The land
laws of the United States were apparently liberal,
but unless the settler could obtain land near a navigable
stream, it was a most difficult matter to buy
even a quarter section and make the improvements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

necessary to successful farming. And since all the
river area had long since been occupied, the Westerners
of 1830 had bought their land in the remote
districts and begun the hard struggle of paying
out." The distance to markets made this an almost
hopeless task, and the holders of the frontier farms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
came to think their lot a peculiarly hard one. They
resisted always; and in hard years, after driving a
herd of cattle or a drove of hogs to the distant market
and receiving therefor barely the cost of production,
they were angry and resentful.</p>

<p class="mid"><a href="images/043-large.jpg">Click to enlarge</a>, <a href="#MAPS">Click to return to Maps list</a></p>

<p>The frontier remedy for these ills was an &ldquo;easier&rdquo;

currency or high prices for commodities, or stay laws
against creditors who pressed for their money. And
since a great number of the Western farmers had
simply taken up their lands, before they were thrown
open to sale, and made improvements on them without
procuring titles, they feared the enforcement of
the federal law against them and clamored for a pre&euml;mption
system which would secure them their land,
when the day of sales did come, at the minimum
price, $1.25 per acre. A still better plan was already
strongly urged, the free gift of small tracts of land
to all who would go West and build homes. Not only
would this be good for the home-seeker, but it would
result in the rapid upbuilding of the great wastes of
the country. Animated by such purposes as these,
Benton and his colleagues in Congress were constantly
gaining strength as their constituents increased
in number.</p>

<p>Thus the restless but devoted followers of Jackson
were developing a program: the removal of the Indians
in order that more cotton and corn might be
grown; the seizure of the territory contiguous to the
western frontier, even at the cost of war with Mexico
and England; the giving of free homesteads to all
who would go West and join in the upbuilding of the
Mississippi Commonwealths; and the improvement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of roadways at national expense in order that Western
products might find better markets. These were
the things which the Westerners ardently desired and
which it was hoped the new President would be able
to obtain for them. Incidentally, he was expected to
set up the rule of the people in the national capital,
and to substitute a more simple life and etiquette
for the formal and fashionable manners which had
come into vogue with Monroe and his Cabinet.</p>

<p>The strength of the Western people was great, and
to the East it appeared ominous. They numbered
in 1830 nearly 4,000,000 souls as compared with
12,500,000 for the country as a whole, and their
increase in the preceding decade had run from 22
per cent in Kentucky to 185 per cent in Illinois.
In the National House of Representatives the West
cast 47 votes in a total of 213; in the Senate their
strength was 18 in a total of 48. But this does not
fairly represent their influence. In western New
York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia there were more
than a million people who counted themselves Westerners,
while in the Carolinas and Georgia a majority,
or more than another half-million, must be
reckoned as adherents of the cause of the &ldquo;Trans-alleghany.&rdquo;
Thus about 6,000,000 of the total
12,500,000 were Western in character and ideals,
to say nothing of the large frontier element in New
England.</p>

<p>In economic strength, however, these Jackson
States and communities were much weaker. They
were isolated. Their surplus crops had no value save
as they were produced within reach of navigable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
rivers. Of these the 5,500,000 people living in the
region drained by the Mississippi and the other
streams which fall into the Gulf of Mexico, exported
about $17,800,000 worth of commodities in 1830, a
<i>per capita</i> value of less than $4. And most of this
surplus output came from the cotton counties of the
lower South, where only a small proportion of the
population of the West dwelt. Still, the herds of
cattle and droves of swine that were driven southward
to the cotton communities or over the mountains
to Eastern cities, and the large quantities of grain
which, after 1825, found its way to market through
the Erie Canal, added greatly to and perhaps doubled
the income of the West from exports down the Mississippi.
When all is told, however, these isolated
people were in the main very poor, as the narratives
of travelers and the journals of preachers attest on
every page.</p>

<p>Yet every year added thousands to the numbers
of Eastern men who migrated West to enjoy some
of the liberty of a region where lands were cheap and
the social life unconventional; every decade added
new voices and able leaders to the Western group in
Congress, who clamored unceasingly for the enactment
of laws aimed at the rapid development of that
section. New England, where the rise of industrial
towns necessitated an increasing number of laborers,
took fright, or had never ceased to be alarmed, at
the westward movement of population; and Eastern
members of Congress, under one pretext or another,
opposed every demand which came up from the West,
every petition of the &ldquo;squatters&rdquo; on the public do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>main.
In the Middle States the building of numerous
canals, turnpikes, and railways called for both
skilled and unskilled laborers. But if everybody ran
off to the West when wages were unsatisfactory, these
improvements could not be made and the old communities
would languish and decay.</p>

<p>Virginia and the South were less disturbed at
the growth of the West, because of their system of
slavery, and because the votes of the new States
could be relied on to support Virginian and Southern
policies in Congress&mdash;a legacy of the old Jeffersonian
alliance of the South with the early
West; and also because of the similar economic and
social life of the two sections. But even the Old
Dominion in the sore economic distress of the late
twenties, due in the main to the desertion of her
tobacco-fields and workshops by thousands of her
most energetic sons, who went to the rich cotton
country, wavered in her loyalty to the younger
States of the West. John Randolph ridiculed in
merciless fashion the &ldquo;sharp-witted&rdquo; Westerners,
whom he would avoid in the highway as &ldquo;one would
a pickpocket&rdquo;; and in both the Carolinas there was
a fear and a dread of the growing West, whose ideals
were too Jeffersonian and whose power waxed greater
with the passing years. Yet Calhoun, Hayne, and
other able Southerners remained true to the new region
and supported Benton in his debates with Foote
and Webster in 1830, perhaps because the whole
Jackson program of 1829 was based upon the alliance
of these forces in the national life.</p>

<p>If the political plans of the Western men of 1830<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
were ambitious and far-reaching, the lives of the
shrewd pioneers were simple, hard, and narrow. The
men wore coats when the weather was cold, and
found shoes more of a nuisance than a comfort during
half the year; and the women rejoiced if they received
a &ldquo;store&rdquo; bonnet once in two years. Wants
were few and the annual <i>per capita</i> expense beyond
what was produced at home was seldom as great as
$10. Peter Cartwright counted himself rich when
he learned that the Methodist annual conference to
which he belonged had added $12 to his regular stipend
of $100 a year.</p>

<p>Most men, including the clergy, owned or rented
farms and followed the plow in season, while wives
and children did outdoor work from morning till
night. Houses were built by the aid of neighbors in
a single day, and extra rooms were improvised by the
judicious hanging of quilts and curtains. A door in
front and another in the rear allowed plenty of fresh
air, though the large crevices between the logs usually
rendered this superfluous. Floors were made of
logs split in halves and laid &ldquo;with backs downward.&rdquo;
Beds and chairs were home-made and especially intended
for the use of the older members of the family,
boys and girls accommodating themselves with
stools or blocks of wood sawed for the purpose.
Meals were prepared in a few moments at the broad
fireside, where a huge crane aided the mother in
swinging her kettles on or off the blazing fire. In
every pretentious home there was a loom for the
weaving of cotton and woolen cloth for family or
neighborhood consumption; and late at night the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
steady thump of the beam proclaimed the industry
of the busy housewife as she put in the last threads
of her &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; or &ldquo;sixth yard.&rdquo; Few were so wealthy
that they could afford the broadcloth which came up
the rivers from New Orleans or over the Erie Canal
from New York; and when some migrating Virginia
squire or Kentucky colonel, master of a thousand
acres of land, did so disport himself on Sundays or
at the races, he appeared in his glossy suit, made by
the hand of his devoted spouse, wrinkled and fretted
in a hundred places, not unlike Lincoln when he first
spoke at Cooper Institute, New York.</p>

<p>Life was simple on the Western farm or distant
frontier, but pleasure, too, had its place, English
sports of Angevin times serving the place of baseball
or golf of to-day. In the older West, Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Missouri, the race-course was the
common playground where horses and men ran their
rounds and won their prizes. To drink deeply of the
strong &ldquo;corn&rdquo; or &ldquo;rye&rdquo; was as common as is the
drinking of wine in France; and races, corn-huskings,
or weddings were seldom closed without drunkenness,
and oftentimes fisticuffs or the more fatal
duel with knife or pistol. Jackson had &ldquo;killed his
man,&rdquo; and Benton had been knocked through a trapdoor
into the basement of a Nashville bar-room;
Clay and Poindexter, the Mississippi Governor and
Senator, had had more than one encounter in which
life was set against life.</p>

<p>If men held human life cheap, they held woman's
honor more than dear, and to give currency to a tale
of slander was tantamount to half a dozen chal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>lenges.
Women were in the minority in the West,
and although they did not vote, they were still of utmost
importance in homes where clothing was handmade
and the needs of numerous children increased
daily. Henry Clay was one of thirteen or fourteen
brothers and sisters, while Thomas Marshall, the
father of the Chief Justice, carried ten or twelve
children with him to his Western home about the
year 1781. But the sorrows of the pioneer women
and the waste of human material were extraordinary.
In those days of hardship and ignorance of the
most rudimentary rules of sanitation, few knew how
to save their children from death due to the simplest
diseases, and the student to-day reads the sad story
in the many tiny tombstones of the old family cemeteries,
knowing well that the great majority rest in
unmarked graves. Many were born and many died
without a fair chance at normal existence.</p>

<p>Western men were seldom members of organized
churches, though the fear of the Deity, natural to
those who witnessed the great &ldquo;freshets&rdquo; and the
storms and cyclones which swept over the plains,
carrying entire villages with them or cutting wide
swaths through the primeval forests, was a powerful
influence upon everyday conduct. Presbyterians,
Baptists, and Methodists, with their strict and hard
Calvinism, penetrated first the wilderness beyond the
mountains and built their rude log churches, in which
stern preachers, like Samuel Doak, of Tennessee, or
Jonathan Going, of Ohio, warned men against the
wrath to come and the fiery furnace below, whose
surging flames were ever ready to swallow up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
consume stiff-necked, yet never-dying sinners. The
simple and superstitious minds of the neglected West
flocked to these little churches or to great camps
where revivalists, like James McCreary, of Kentucky,
or the later Bishop Soule, of Ohio, preached for
weeks in succession and seemed to work miracles
hardly less wonderful than those of New Testament
times. Hundreds were &ldquo;stricken&rdquo; on a single day
and were later gathered into the church clothed and
in their right minds. Before 1830 the greater denominations
of the East and South realized the importance
of the West as a semi-destitute land to
which missionaries should be sent, though by this
time the churches of the older border and of most of
the great valley were self-supporting and the population
could no longer complain that the Gospel had
never been preached to them.</p>

<p>While the civilizing hand of the churches was being
spread over the West, schools and colleges were
built and opened to students. The liberal land grants
of the Federal Government were made to serve the
cause of common schools, while institutions of higher
learning flourished at Lexington, Natchez, Granville
(Ohio), and Hanover (Indiana),&mdash;schools where
many of the statesmen of the Civil War period were
trained and where preachers prepared themselves for
their strenuous labors in a poor country. The civilizing
forces of religion and education were rapidly
leavening the lump of hard Western life and preparing
it for the great days and the awful struggle that
were so soon to come. Books found their way into
the Athens of the West, as Lexington was called,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and gradually, under the fostering care of Henry
Clay, the Mechanics' Library came to play an important
part. St. Louis, too, boasted of its Mercantile
Library; and there were numerous other collections
of religious writings, history, and the English
poets, mostly in private hands like those of John M.
Peck, of Illinois. Newspapers, such as the <i>Republican</i>
of St. Louis, the Maysville <i>Eagle</i>, or the
Louisville <i>Advertiser</i>, carried their weekly or semi-weekly
burden of neighborhood gossip and political
news to near-by villages and distant settlements.</p>

<p>The roads were also improving and steadily expanding
the area of productive farming, though all,
or nearly all, led to the river ports or the old fort
towns like La Porte, Indiana, or Detroit and Cleveland
on the Lakes. The Erie and the Ohio Canals
were already turning exports and communication
northeastward, while the Lake steamers were adding
their share to the development of the Western frontier;
but the great river steamers, the City of New
Orleans and the Crescent, which the preachers compared
to ancient Babylon, as centers of vice and lewd
fashion, were the marvels of the West, and they carried
the burden of grain, tobacco, and cotton which
crowded the wharves of New Orleans. Cincinnati
was the pork-packing and manufacturing center of
the West, sending its salted meats and farm implements
to the plantations of the lower South in ever-increasing
volume. St. Louis was the home of the
most important commercial monopoly of the time,
the American Fur Company, which had an undue
influence in national politics, and of which John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

Jacob Astor was the millionaire head, to whom all
Americans looked up as one of the great figures of
his generation. From the old half-French, half-American
town caravans of explorers, trappers, and
traders set out each spring for the Far Northwest,
whence they returned annually with their loads of
furs and their tales of the wonderful Oregon country.
But New Orleans, with its population of 50,000,
its European life and rather easy morals, its slave
marts and miles of cotton wharves, was the wonder of
the world to Western eyes like those of young Abraham
Lincoln, who visited the city about this time.
There, rich men lived in splendid mansions, served by
scores of negro slaves; there, great newspapers were
published and shrewd speculators from all parts of
the world bought cotton and imported luxuries for
the newly rich of the Southwest.</p>

<p>It was this great West, pulsating with life and
vigor, filled with hope for the future, restless and
eager, at once democratic and imperialistic, which
put the resolute and dictatorial Andrew Jackson in
the President's chair in 1829. And never was constituency
more truly represented than was that of
the West in the wiry old man whom they called
&ldquo;Old Hickory.&rdquo; Accustomed to the hardships of the
poor in his youth and to the responsibility of the
well-to-do merchant and cotton planter in middle
life, he had experienced most that was common to
his fellows and had gained a prestige which in their
admiring eyes surpassed that of all other men since
Thomas Jefferson. Brave and generous, plain-spoken
and sometimes boisterous, he embodied most of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
qualities that compelled admiration throughout the
Mississippi Valley. No matter what Webster or
Calhoun or even Clay said of &ldquo;Old Hickory,&rdquo; it was
not believed in the back-country until the President
himself had confirmed the story. Jackson was the
second American President who so understood &ldquo;his
people&rdquo; that he could interpret them and by intuition
scent the course the popular mind would take&mdash;particularly
in the West.</p>

<p>To be sure, there were small groups of Westerners
who opposed him and whom he did not represent:
some of the counties of Ohio, a part of the Blue-Grass
region of Kentucky, and a narrow strip of
Mississippi which lay in the southwestern part of
the State, and finally the French and mercantile
elements of New Orleans; but these were never
strong enough to deprive him of any object at which
he aimed. It was well-nigh &ldquo;King Andrew I,&rdquo; as
some Eastern papers were accustomed to term him
in a weak attempt at ridicule.</p>

<p>Thus appeared the new r&eacute;gime in 1829, in so far
as its Western majority and base of support were
concerned. How the conservative East, with its serious
doubts about democracy, and the older Southern
leaders, uneasy lest slavery should be undermined,
would find themselves in the new system is a problem
which our next chapters must seek to disclose.</p>

<h4>THE EAST</h4>

<p>When the West under the guidance and tutelage
of Jackson, Calhoun, and Benton took possession of
the national administration in 1829, the older and
more cultured elements and classes of the East trembled
for their country and for the institutions they
held dear. The day was dark to John Quincy Adams
and his followers, not only because they had been
deprived of power, but because the rural sections of
the East, the towns and villages which had been
active and prosperous from 1783 to 1807, showed
almost as many signs of stagnation and premature
decay as did the Old Dominion, where public men
were in a state of alarm and dismay. For fifteen
years the highways of New York and Pennsylvania
had borne their burden of New England emigrants,
laden with their meager belongings, as they journeyed
westward to the Mohawk country, western
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other rising communities
of the West. Between 1820 and 1830 the population
of New England as a whole increased but
slightly, while in many counties of New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, and Connecticut there was an actual
decline. Ambitious young men or discouraged heads
of families moved northeastward to the freer lands
of Maine or to the Far West, without seeming love
for the older haunts or thought for the fortunes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the Commonwealths which had given them birth.
And New York, whose population increased from
1,400,000 in 1820 to 2,400,000 in 1840, drew
heavily upon her eastern neighbors; Pennsylvania,
of more steady habits, drew less from New England
than her immediate neighbors, though both New York
and Pennsylvania gave freely to the West. There
was thus a steady drift of the people from their
Eastern homes to the better opportunities of the
Middle States, while from these, in turn, large numbers
joined the more courageous who were never
content until they built their cabins along the river
borders or on the prairies of the Northwest.</p>

<p>The total population of the country in 1830 was
nearly 13,000,000, while that of the East, including
New England, the Middle States, and Maryland, was
a little more than 6,000,000. Between 1820 and
1840 the population of the country increased from
9,654,000 to 17,669,000; that of the East increased
from 4,850,000 to 7,350,000, of which 650,000 had
come from Europe. This represented a growth of
only fifty per cent in twenty years. But the rival
South, as a whole, and this includes Kentucky and
Missouri, had increased her population during the
same period from 4,009,000 to 7,748,000, a growth
of ninety per cent; while the West, as a whole, including
Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri, had
grown from less than 1,000,000 to nearly 4,000,000.
These facts were significant and really distressing to
conservative politicians; they explain the jealous rivalry
of the sections, and the alliance of the South
and West foreboded the day when the more culti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>vated
and the better settled region of the young
nation, if it may be called a nation, would find itself
in a hopeless minority.</p>

<p>If we add to this the fact that the lands of the East
were the poorest in the Union and that their total
area was less than 175,000 square miles, while those
of the South were counted rich and embraced an area
of 880,000 square miles, we shall understand how
statesmen who listened to the jubilations of the Jackson
men felt and envisaged the future&mdash;a future
which the South alone might command; but which she
would certainly dominate if she could only succeed
in keeping the West true to her present allegiance.</p>

<p>But economic and social changes were taking place
which gave the darkening cloud a silver lining. On
an irregular but narrow belt of land stretching from
southeastern Maine to the Chesapeake Bay manufacturing
establishments had been erected, towns and
cities had sprung into existence as if by magic, and migration
from the poor farms and the hard conditions
of New England country life was also turning to the
mill centers, and thus giving promise of a new East,
whose life should be industrial and urban like that of
smoky, grimy Lancashire, England. The older commercial
and seafaring interests, which had given the
Federalists their power and made the American flag
known on every sea, were now giving way to the
vigorous young captains of industry whose mills at
Lowell, Providence, New Haven, New York, Philadelphia,
and Baltimore gave employment to thousands
of people. Much of the money which had made the
New Englanders go down to the sea in ships was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
invested in manufactures. The woolen mills of the
East produced in 1820 a little more than $4,000,000
worth of cloth, the cotton mills, $4,834,000; but in
1830 the yearly manufactures of wool, cotton, and
iron were estimated by the Government as worth
$58,500,000. Yet the total investment in these enterprises
was not much in excess of $100,000,000. In
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania
the growth had been miraculous, and the
profits were enormous, if we except one or two years
for the woolen interests.</p>

<p>So that while the total annual crop value of Southern
plantations amounted to $40,000,000, and the

<i>per capita</i> wealth of the white people of the so-called
black belt was very large, the returns from three industries
located in a much narrower industrial belt
of the East were more than a third greater. The taxable
value of the slaves who produced most of the
cotton and tobacco was not less than $1,000,000,000;
the total investments of the East in manufactures of
all kinds was certainly not more than a fourth as great
as that in slaves. And what made this development
the more significant was the fact that nearly all that
the black belt produced was sold in Europe, while
nearly all that the industrial belt produced was sold
to the people of the United States, mostly to States
which were not engaged in manufacturing at all.</p>

<p>A portentous revolution was taking place. Before
1820 nearly all the wool of the country had been made
into cloth by hand in the homes of the people, and the
ratio of home manufactures to population was about
the same in most of the States. Now the sheep-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>raisers
sold their wool to the mill men, who sold the
country the finished product and whose factories were
concentrated in a small district. The cotton mills had
been a negligible economic factor in 1812; now their
owners employed a capital of $30,000,000 to $35,000,000
and supplied work for 70,000 laborers.
From the farms of the interior, where life was in the
open, the poorer and less ambitious elements of the
population, who were not attracted to the West,
were drawn to the growing industrial towns, where
they lived, a family in a room, worked twelve to
fourteen hours a day, amidst unsanitary and even immoral
surroundings, for wages which ranged from
one dollar to six dollars per week. The cost of living
was, to be sure, correspondingly low; but when the
year of toil for men, women, and children of all ages
was told, there was usually an unpaid account at the
company's store, and the chance of bettering one's
worldly fortunes appeared almost hopeless. Emigration
to the West was the only escape, and the difficulties
of such an escape, the cost of sustenance for
the long journey, on foot, the greater cost of building
a cabin in the forest and maintaining one's family
till a crop could be harvested, and the necessity
of buying the land on which the cabin was to be
raised, made the undertaking heroic. Thus, when the
mill life was once begun it was seldom deserted.</p>

<p>Without educational advantages, save in the most
rudimentary way, without any fair prospect of ever
becoming independent or of materially improving
their status, these mill workers kept up the daily
round of labor, earning the millions which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
laying the foundations of a new and greater East,
eventually a new United States, and voting, in so far
as they exercised the right of suffrage at all, for the
cause of their masters, against the &ldquo;slave-drivers&rdquo;
of the South and for protection to manufactures as
a means of defending themselves against their poorer
brethren of Europe. As to their total number, we
have no more reliable estimate than that of McMaster,
who says there were not less than two million
operatives in all lines of industry in 1825. Nobody
thought of these people as slaves; and most people
thought they must be happy to escape the dull life
of the country, and that fourteen hours' work was a
normal human exercise. A worthless father who
lived on the labor of little children of his own begetting
was counted lucky to have children to work
for him; and the girl who entered the primrose
path as a possible way of escape from her hard surroundings
was then as now promptly ruled out of
the pale of human sympathy and consigned to the
lake of everlasting fire and brimstone.</p>

<p>Another great interest had grown to immense
proportions in the East of 1830&mdash;the financial.
Beginning with the flush times of Hamilton's leadership,
the financier had grown in power and influence,
sometimes purposely organizing a monopolistic control
over the money of the public, as in the case of
the Suffolk Bank of Boston, sometimes mercilessly
robbing depositors, as in the notorious defalcation
of the Derby Bank of Connecticut in 1825, until it
had become a serious national problem not merely
to regulate the currency of the country, but to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
curb the rapacity of those who, under one pretense
or another, violated the laws of all the States in
order to heap up hasty fortunes. In 1815 there
had been 208 banks in the country, mainly in the
Middle States and New England, with a capital
of $82,000,000; at the end of the year 1833 there
were 502 banks with a capital of $168,829,000. At
the end of the second war with England, there were
$17,000,000 of specie in the banks; eighteen years
later, when the capital had doubled, loans had
greatly increased, and notes in circulation were
$61,000,000, there were still just $17,000,000 of
gold and silver in all the banks.</p>

<p>The business of the East naturally tended to the
concentration of the financial resources of the country
within her towns, but the location of 414 of the
502 banks of the country in the narrow section under
consideration would seem to indicate something
more than a natural tendency. The six million people
of the East enjoyed three times as many banking
facilities, when we consider the amount of money
in circulation, as the seven million Southerners and
Westerners. New York alone had a banking capital
of $28,000,000, Massachusetts $21,000,000, and
the <i>per capita</i> circulation of money in the East was
nearly $9, while that of the West was $2. To him
that hath shall be given is a familiar axiom which
seemed doubly true of the United States at the
time of Jackson's accession to power.</p>

<p>All signs pointed to a congestion of the financial
resources of the whole country in Philadelphia, New
York, and Boston. The great National Bank, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

its $35,000,000 capital and loans of $40,000,000,
was located in Philadelphia; New York City had
not so strong a banking system, but the growth of
her real estate values was $40,000,000 in the five
years preceding 1831; and the tax valuation of the
property of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, in which
Boston was located, was $86,000,000 as against
$208,000,000 for the whole State.</p>

<p>The masters of this region were reaching out for
the commerce of the West through the Erie Canal,
which made northern and central Ohio the hinterland
of New York; through the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which
were aimed at western Virginia and the Ohio Valley.
The shipping interests of New England and
New York did the same for the South, whose millions
of bales of cotton all went north or to Europe
in eastern-made and eastern-owned vessels.
And while these enterprising leaders sought to
control the commerce of the country, they also
knitted together their own towns and river valleys
by canals and turnpikes. Boston and New Haven
were almost united by canals and railroads in 1830;
the Delaware and the Susquehanna were paralleled
far into the interior in order to bring the produce of
the country to the manufacturing centers. And a
railway connected Philadelphia with the rich Susquehanna
Basin, whose commerce had hitherto been
controlled by Baltimore. Pittsburg was actually
tied to the East before 1835 by water and railroad
routes. Trade, manufactures, and finance; railways,
canals, and home markets were the great subjects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of conversation in the East, just as cotton, slaves,
and land formed the trinity of Southern thinking.</p>

<p>The men who owned the industrial plants and
managed the large banks and projected the ambitious
railway and canal systems, the stockholders
and the officers, the factors and storekeepers, were
drawn from the same sturdy New England and
Middle States stock, the small farmers and little
merchants who had composed the democracy which
had fought the Revolution. Retired sea-captains
and owners of sailing-vessels joined the new r&eacute;gime
as profits came in and the art of watering stock was
understood. Throughout the East, from Chesapeake
Bay to Augusta, Maine, wherever there were
good waterfalls, great brick buildings were rising
story upon story, proclaiming the new prosperity
and enticing the hordes of workers so necessary to
the new system. The old-fashioned mansions of retired
traders or prosperous shipbuilders, which had
so long adorned the hills of the coast towns, were
giving way to the larger houses of the captains of
industry who built up the inland towns or created
the suburbs of the greater cities.</p>

<p>Like the planters of the South, with their two
million slaves, these able and prosperous makers of a
new era in the East had their two million operatives,
and as in the planting districts, the working day was
from sun to sun. Carrying the comparison further,
the industrial and financial region was relatively
small, embracing much less of the area of the country
than did that of the black belt.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>From southeastern Maine to Boston, Providence,
New Haven, New York City, and on to Baltimore,
with a Western extension to Pittsburg, this irregular,
now widening, now contracting, strip of country extended.
It embraced the strategic positions, the falls
of the rivers, the places whence ships could sail laden
with the products of the industries or return with the
raw materials necessary to their operation; it included
the old commercial towns where the surplus
capital of the East had been collected and where now
gathered the populations which composed the districts
whose spokesmen exerted the real strength of
the North in the National Congress. It was this articulate
East, the growing power of industry and finance,
the promise of greater prosperity to come, which drew
to it, like iron filings to a magnet, the talented and
the ambitious men of the time, just as the black belt
was the articulate part of the South for which men
of ability and influence spoke in the national assemblies
which gathered from year to year in Washington.</p>

<p>But the older mercantile and seafaring interests
sometimes resisted the industrial movement and made
precarious alliances with the South on the basis of a
national free-trade policy. The great Boston merchants
actually turned to Hayne, of South Carolina,
in 1827, to represent them and their cause in Congress.
The Winslows, Goddards, and Lees who thus
appealed to a Southern Senator were representatives
of the older order, of the same declining class in New
York and Philadelphia which had in years past controlled
affairs in the East and made alliances with
the aristocratic leaders of the South.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p> In a hopeless minority in their own States before 1830, they looked
to the South for relief, and at least understood the
politics of the planters. Their successors composed
the nucleus of the party of Cushing, Everett, and
Winthrop in 1860. It is difficult for us in our day of
great things to understand the industrial and social
revolution of the decade which preceded the inauguration
of the first Western President, and it was
difficult for men to make the transition from the
small farmer system of Jefferson's day to the industrial
r&eacute;gime of 1830; many good people were broken
in the process, while whole classes of the population
exchanged the life of the open country for that of the
crowded and unsanitary towns, exchanged a rude and
hard independence for a semi-servile subjection.</p>

<p>The new Eastern r&eacute;gime readily enlisted the support
of the old professional classes. The clergy and
the votaries of the law, always doing the bidding of
the strongest in society, promptly took their places
in the system. When dignitaries of an Eastern town
gradually laid aside their rough farmers' clothes and
put on the smooth garbs of directors of corporations
or financial magnates, the legal briefs and sermons
underwent a similar change. Social amenities displaced
Calvinistic theology; dancing, which had been a
crime against the Church, became mere frivolity and
finally an innocent pastime. Leading lawyers ceased
to plead in petit courts to inferior magistrates, and
learned to devise forms of contracts, to lobby in legislatures,
or appear with the great Maryland and Virginia
practitioners before the Federal Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The legal profession of the East naturally made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
common cause with their clients. The state courts,
already accustomed to curb the democracy of the
time and declare public enactments unconstitutional,
when the interests of property required, as readily
joined the new standards. The careers of Justice
Parsons of Massachusetts and Chancellor Kent of
New York, to whom all judges and lawyers of the
time looked up as sources of inspiration, illustrate admirably
the common tendency. Everywhere in the
East as in the South &ldquo;independent&rdquo; judges asserted
the power to declare laws unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The national courts had undergone the same evolution,
except that they had met with violent opposition
in the South and West. In many decisions from
1792 to 1830 the Federal Supreme Court asserted
its authority over Congress, the President, and the
States. In almost all of these instances the federal
judges found the heartiest support from the East.
The great institution over which Chief Justice Marshall
presided with such perfect dignity, and which
was not paralleled anywhere else in the world, lent
its support to the interests of the East. If the constitutionality
of the tariff were denied by irate planters,
Eastern men pointed to decisions of the Federal Supreme
Court; if the powers of the General Government
under which the industrial or financial interests
of the East operated were questioned, it was easy
to find a decision of Chief Justice Marshall to cover
the case. Nothing proved more fortunate for the leaders
of the industrial revolution than the almost constant
support of the federal courts and of the legal
profession as a whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The compact social life of the industrial towns was
still further reinforced by the clergy. In the shift
from a stern theology to an easy-going religious philosophy,
William Ellery Channing was a conspicuous
leader. Harvard had already become a Unitarian
center, and in 1836 the Transcendental Club was
organized in Boston with Ralph Waldo Emerson, a
preacher in revolt against the old theology, as one of
its leaders; high-toned men, whose minds revolted
alike against the old Puritanism, the grosser talk of
rates of exchange and the building of common roadways,
found consolation in speculative philosophy and
romantic literature. The <i>North American Review</i>
was already fifteen years old, and the best minds of
the country were happy to have their thought and
inspirations printed in its staid columns. Boston
was a state of mind in 1830, and a good Methodist
preacher who visited the city a little later lamented
the lapse from the great virtues and the great theology
of the Mathers.</p>

<p>But outside of Boston and its university suburb,
there was little patience with a new religion or with
a theology which did not teach the world the total
depravity of man and the vengeance of an angry
Deity consigning his wayward children to everlasting
perdition. Southern gentlemen like Calhoun or
Hayne might accept the mild and humane God of
Channing, but not the farmers of the rural districts
or the business men of the small towns.</p>

<p>If Boston cultivated philosophy and religious reform,
New York was the seat of a literature that
was read. Washington Irving, the author of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>

<i>Sketch-Book</i> and <i>Tales of a Traveller</i>, was just returning
from a long and triumphant literary sojourn
in Europe to make his home on the Hudson. James
Fenimore Cooper was publishing his <i>Leather Stocking
Tales</i>, which have made the hair on so many
boys' heads stand on end. William Cullen Bryant
was making the <i>New York Evening Post</i> the organ
of American culture and setting the pace for the better
element of the press. In Philadelphia, Carey and
Lea were alternately publishing the writings of
struggling literary lights and fiery pamphlets on the
tariff and internal improvements. In 1832 John
Pendleton Kennedy, of Maryland, published his
<i>Swallow Barn</i>, a novel which portrayed the easy-going
life of the Virginia planters; and in Richmond,
William Wirt, disgusted with Western politics,
rested on his laurels as the author of the <i>British
Spy</i> and the <i>Life of Patrick Henry</i>. To match the

<i>North American Review</i> the Charleston lovers of
literature were publishing their excellent <i>Southern
Review</i>. Even history was not without her muses.
Reverend Jared Sparks was editing all the crudities
of grammar and errors of spelling out of Washington's
fourteen volumes of correspondence; George
Ticknor, a young professor at Harvard, was beginning
the work which was to culminate in his famous
<i>History of Spanish Literature</i>; and George Bancroft
was writing a <i>History of the United States</i>
which was to win him international fame and ultimately
to secure him a seat in the Cabinet of President
Polk.</p>

<p>If literature and history were beginning to thrive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in New England and the Middle States, painting
and sculpture also had their devotees. Allston and
Greenough had won laurels in Boston; Inman and
Sully were making portraits in Philadelphia which
well-to-do Middle States lawyers and Southern planters
liked well enough to pay for in good banknotes;
even in far-off Kentucky Joel T. Hart was making
the busts of great American politicians on which his
title to distinction was to rest. And Charleston, never
outdone in <i>ante-bellum</i> times, encouraged a real
genius in James de Veaux, the painter, so soon to
fall a victim to tuberculosis. That was a promising
religious, literary, and artistic life, which kept time
to the looms of the industrial belt or idealized the
nascent feudalism of the South. But we must turn
to the fierce economic and political struggles about
to be reopened in Washington&mdash;struggles in which
Americans of that day as well as of this always take
supreme interest.</p>

<p>The change in Massachusetts and Connecticut
from a defiant particularism and an uncompromising
free-trade policy, during the short years of 1815 to
1830, to a positive nationalism and emphatic protective
program parallels exactly the change at the same
time in South Carolina from nationalism and a protective
tariff to a strict states-rights and an unbending
free-trade system. If Calhoun turned sharp corners
in those years, Webster proved equally agile.
The whole life of the East was being reconstructed,
and all classes were adapting themselves to the new
organization. The small farmers, allies in 1804 of
Thomas Jefferson and his up-country democracy, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>came
ancillary to the industrial towns where they
found markets for their products; and the new river
and canal and railroad towns were but the recent
creations of the new order. With the exception of a
few remote counties and certain old-fashioned merchants,
all New England and the Middle States
ranged themselves around the dominant industrial
masters and presented an almost solid front to the
Southern and Western combination which had swept
the country in 1828. There was no doubt that Adams,
Webster, and Clay would renew the fight in time to
make an issue in 1832.</p>

<p>And their case was by no means hopeless. In the
electoral college of 1832 these Northeastern States
would cast 131 of the total 286 votes. If the industrial
forces could hold their communities together as
the West had learned to do, and regain their former
hold on Ohio, their candidate would again be successful.
Losing the Presidency, they would still
have, after the apportionment of 1831, a majority of
10 in the Federal House of Representatives, which
would guarantee the protective policy against serious
modification. And the moral support of the Supreme
Court was not without value. Thus if the new
President and the Senate be conceded, the popular
branch of Congress and the national judiciary would
make steady bulwarks.</p>

<p>If there were sections of New England, like
Maine, or of the Middle States, like western Pennsylvania,
whose people would not support the industrial
program, there were dominant sections of the
old South, like eastern Virginia and all South Caro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>lina,
where the leaders either feared or hated Jackson.
Nor did all the West love the South. In the
States which bordered the Ohio River most men demanded
internal improvements at national expense,
which all knew the South could not grant. With the
ablest New England and Middle States leaders in the
Senate and House, why might not the arrangement of
1825 be renewed? It was, then, with every expectation
of victory in 1832 that the sanguine Clay came back
to Congress in December, 1831; even John Quincy
Adams, who now became a member of the House,
was not without hope that the ill-selected Cabinet of
Jackson would go to pieces and that a &ldquo;restoration&rdquo;
would follow in due time. Washington was to be the
scene of still another conflict of the sections that
would threaten the very existence of the Union, not
yet accustomed to the idea of a compact nationality.</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>The best sources for the growth of the various industries before
1830 are government documents. <i>The Report on Manufactures,
Executive Documents</i>, 22d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 vols., is a rare and
valuable work; and <i>Executive Documents</i>, 34th Cong., 1st Sess.,
vol. 4, gives the statistics of manufactures down to 1850 by States.
Darby and Dwight's <i>New Gazetteer of the United States</i> (1833), and
J. L. Bishop's <i>History of American Manufactures</i> (1868), are useful
if sometimes exasperating. Miss Katharine Coman's <i>The Industrial
History of the United States</i> (1910) is the best account for
general use. J. B. McMaster's <i>History of the United States</i>, vol. v
(1900), and F. J. Turner's <i>The Rise of the New West</i> already cited
(1906), are always serviceable. For a cross-section of the industrial
revolution in New England, read C. F. Adams's <i>Three Episodes of
Massachusetts History</i> (1903). Davis R. Dewey's <i>Financial History
of the United States</i> (1903) is standard; and A. C. McLaughlin's

<i>The Court, the Constitution and Parties</i> (1912), gives the best account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of the beginnings of judicial supremacy, while W. G. Sumner's
<i>History of American Banking</i> (1896) tells the story of the banks by
sections. The <i>American Commonwealth</i> histories are serviceable
for the individual States. For the biographies of leading statesmen,
the <i>American Statesmen</i> and <i>American Crises</i> series are satisfying.
Intellectual life is well treated in W. P. Trent's <i>History of
American Literature</i> (1903), G. W. Sheldon's <i>American Painters</i>

(1899), and Lorado Taft's <i>History of American Sculpture</i> (1903).</p>

<h4>CONFLICT AND COMPROMISE</h4>

<p>The man against whom these powerful leaders were
directing all their energies was still counted an amateur
in politics, irascible and indiscreet. He was
laughed at in the cities as a boor and condemned in
New England as an ignoramus, though Harvard College,
under some strange inspiration, was soon to
award him the doctorate of laws. Having come to
power by means of a combination of South and West,
Jackson had found his followers divided and somewhat
unmanageable. Half the members of his Cabinet,
S. D. Ingham, Secretary of the Treasury; John
Branch, Secretary of the Navy; and John M. Berrien,
Attorney-General, looked to Calhoun as their chief,
while the others, Martin Van Buren; Secretary of
State, John H. Eaton, Secretary of War, and William
T. Barry, the Postmaster-General, distrusted
their colleagues and clung to the President. It was
natural, therefore, that cabinet meetings should be
embarrassing and that a nondescript group of clerks
and newspaper editors, William B. Lewis, Frank P.
Blair, and Amos Kendall, all from the West, should
become a sort of closet cabinet with whom Jackson
should take council.</p>

<p>Moreover, Jackson increased his difficulties by
gratifying the Western demand that a clean sweep
in the offices should be made. New and untried men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and hot-headed partisans were placed in the thousands
of vacancies created by removals. Such a
change in the civil and subordinate offices of the
Government had never before been made, and Washington
society, which always takes a hearty interest
in the offices, was not slow to manifest its contempt
for &ldquo;the man of the people&rdquo; and his &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; followers.
But there was still another trouble. Secretary
Eaton had married the daughter of a tavern-keeper;
her reputation was unsavory and notorious. She now
proposed to enter Washington social life as a leader,
and Jackson gave her his blessing. The wives of the
members of the Cabinet refused to recognize Mrs.
Eaton, and a social war followed, in which President,
preachers to the various local churches, and newspaper
editors had their say. Division in the Cabinet,
bitter enmity between certain leaders of the party,
and the greater war between the powerful industrial
and agricultural sections of the country gave every
assurance that a storm was approaching.</p>

<p>To postpone the evil day Jackson resorted to evasions
and oracular utterances on the tariff and the
other serious problems in all his public papers and
speeches. But the South pressed every day its free-trade
program; the East demanded at least a continuation
of the measure of protection already accorded
to its interests; and the West, really needing
roadways and canals, insisted on the building of these
improvements and on the opening of the public lands
to settlement on easier terms. If the President yielded
to any of these groups, his administration was likely
to fail. He naturally sought to shift the issue and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>

felt the public pulse on the question of a renewal of
the charter of the National Bank, which was not to
expire till 1836. This was looking to the future;
but on this subject it was possible to continue the
union of South and West. The first annual message,
in which the Bank was discussed, aroused at once
the great financial interests, and they set in motion
influences which speedily isolated the President and
secured to the Bank the enthusiastic support of a
Cabinet, divided on everything else, and of a majority
of both houses of Congress. Instead of preventing
a disruption of his party, Jackson had only hastened
the event.</p>

<p>The people of South Carolina, supported as they
hoped by most of the South, pressed through Calhoun,
during the winter of 1828-29 and again in
1829-30, for some assurance that the President
would aid them in their attack upon the protective
policy of the Government, threatening state intervention
in case of refusal. The East was no less insistent
that nothing should be done. Congress seemed
to be completely deadlocked. Under these circumstances
Senator Foote, of Connecticut, voicing the
fears of his section, introduced December 29, 1829,
his famous resolution which contemplated the discontinuance
of the federal land sales and the substantial
curbing of the growing West. It was a blow
at Benton and Jackson which was at once accepted
by all the West as a challenge. The representatives
of all three sections were deeply interested. Benton
took the lead in the discussion which followed, and
he urged once more his pre&euml;mption and graduation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
bills. In the former he would guarantee the prior
claims of squatters on lands they had already unlawfully
taken up; in the latter he meant to regulate
the price of public lands according to quality and
location. In both the object was to make the way
of the pioneer easy; and the West supported him
solidly. Whether the South would keep its tacit
pledges in the face of Jackson's non-committal attitude
on the tariff was the query of all until Hayne, an
intimate friend of Calhoun and the recognized spokesman
of his section, arose on January 19, 1830, and
took the strongest ground on behalf of Benton and
the West, and attacked the East for its long-continued
resistance to westward expansion. The next
day Webster made reply, and the debate between
the two representative men continued to the end of the
month. The importance to the present-day reader of
this discussion consists in the revelation of the directly
opposing and hostile attitudes of South and
East on the great problems then before the country:
(1) the South would support the West in its policy
of easy lands and rapid development; the East would
resist that policy; (2) the East would appeal to the
nationalist sentiment of the interior and the West
on behalf of its program of protection to industry,
while the South would resist that program even to
the extent of declaring national tariff laws null and
void. Hayne and Benton showed in their speeches
the substantial solidarity of the alliance of South and
West. Webster undertook to break that alliance by
his powerful appeal to the feelings of Western men
who loved the Union, which the New Englander<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sought to show to be in especial danger. What was
really on trial was the American system, the Tariff
of 1828. It was a serious national crisis, as Calhoun
wrote in May following: &ldquo;The times are perilous
beyond any that I have ever witnessed; all the great
interests of the country are coming into conflict.&rdquo;
The protectionists thought they must control the
country or the Union would be worth little to them;
the Southern free traders insisted upon the mastery
of the Government or else they would have a quiet
dissolution of the Confederation; while the Western
men must have freer control of the public lands and
more immigrants or their sturdy nationalism would
rapidly disappear.</p>

<p>Having failed for the moment to rally the leaders
of his disintegrating party on the Bank issue, Jackson
and his intimate advisers decided that above all
things it was necessary for the old hero to stand
again for the Presidency in the next election. Van
Buren, who had been steadily growing in the estimation
of Jackson, while Calhoun had been losing
ground, was the foremost to urge a second term despite
the understanding and the public promises that
Jackson was to hold office only one term. Amos
Kendall and William B. Lewis supported his view
heartily, fearing as they did that Henry Clay would
otherwise be the next President. At the dinner on
Jefferson Day, April 13, 1830, for which elaborate
preparations had been made, the President chose
to give expression to more decided opinions than had
been customary during his first year in office. His
toast, &ldquo;The Union, it must be preserved,&rdquo; was akin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

to the utterances of Webster in the debate with
Hayne. It was plain to the South that he would not
longer support their contentions, that he would appeal
to the same nationalist sentiment which had been
shown to exist by the speeches of the great New
England orator. The cause of the Southern radicals
was lost in so far as it depended on the President,
and, moreover, the arrangement whereby
Calhoun was to succeed Jackson was dissolved.
South Carolina, so long a leader in public life, was
isolated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the friends of Clay and the devotees of
the tariff had prepared an internal improvements
measure which was drawn so that the appropriation
would apply to purposes wholly within the State of
Kentucky. The Maysville Road Bill proposed to
build a national highway from Maysville on the Ohio
to Lexington, Clay's home, and it was drawn in
order to compel the President to exercise his right
of veto on a proposition in which the West was interested,
and thus break down his popularity in that
region. The proposed law came to him in May. Van
Buren had been sounding public opinion in the
Middle States, and with some hesitation he advised
a veto. The President was of the same mind, and a
vigorous veto message was sent to Congress. To the
dismay of the tariff men, the country approved
heartily, the West giving every evidence of its continued
faith in the Executive. The atmosphere in
Washington began to clear up; it was plain that a
reorganization of the Cabinet must ensue, and that
the lower South, as yet in sympathy with the stern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
anti-tariff policy of Calhoun, must be won away from
the South Carolinian. It seemed that the West
would support the President even if it were called
upon to give up something that was held to be very
important.</p>

<p>In due time William B. Lewis produced a letter
from William H. Crawford which showed, what
Jackson must have known since the summer of 1828,
that Calhoun had not been the President's defender
in 1818, when he was threatened with court-martial
for his conduct during the Seminole War. Jackson
now made an issue of this, and welcomed a controversy
with the man who had done most to elevate
him to the Presidency. Mrs. Eaton also became a
more important character, and the attitude of the
families of other members of the Cabinet were made
subjects of official discussion and displeasure. Calhoun's
friends were commanded to receive her into
their circle or take the consequences. When these
refused, it seemed that this tempest in a teapot was
about to become a grave matter of state. None knew
better than Jackson and Calhoun that other and
deeper causes were forcing the disruption of the
party of 1828, the alliance which had driven Adams
and Clay from office.</p>

<p>Convinced that Van Buren had been the marplot
of the Administration, Calhoun attacked him publicly,
and all the world saw what some astute minds had
long seen, that the two wings of the party in power
were irreconcilable enemies. Congress adjourned in
March, 1831, and in April the President demanded
the resignations of all the friends of the Vice-Presi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>dent
in the Cabinet. Calhoun and Hayne returned
sadly to their constituents to advise actual resistance
to the tariff, since both the President&mdash;"an ungrateful
son of Carolina"&mdash;and Congress had, during
two years, refused all relief to the suffering planters.
Not one of the problems, the solution of which had
been the purpose of Jackson's election, had been settled
or seriously attacked. The East had defeated
Benton's land program; the President had refused
to take up the tariff; and internal improvements as
a national policy had only been toyed with in the
Maysville Bill. As Calhoun had said, all the great
interests of the country had come into conflict, and
even the most resolute of men knew not how to proceed.</p>

<p>But Jackson gathered about him a new official
family who were supposed to owe no double allegiance.
Edward Livingston, of Louisiana, protectionist,
became Secretary of State in place of Van
Buren, who had resigned for appearance' sake; Louis
McLane, of Delaware, a conservative party leader of
protectionist views, was made Secretary of the Treasury
while Roger B. Taney, a former Federalist of
Maryland, became Attorney-General. Lewis Cass,
Secretary of War, was the only distinctly Western
man in this new body. Jackson seems to have expected
to make the Bank question the great issue
between his party and that of Clay, but the new Cabinet
soon proved as strongly pro-Bank as the old one
had been, and he must still rely on the &ldquo;kitchen
council&rdquo; for support in that direction.</p>

<p>The initiative in the great sectional struggle which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
all foresaw was left to South Carolina, but the men
of that planter Commonwealth refused to throw discretion
to the winds. The price of cotton was falling
and the tribute to the manufacturer under the law of
1828 seemed to be more burdensome than ever; yet it
might be well to try Congress again. The new Congress,
which would assemble in December, 1831,
might give relief. This was Calhoun's last recourse;
if it failed nullification must follow.</p>

<p>When the next Congress assembled, Clay was in
the Senate and John Quincy Adams, his former ally,
was just beginning his long career as a member of the
House. Webster and the other New England tariff
advocates were there, and as unbending as the Southerners
themselves. The President sent in a non-committal
message on the burning question, and even on
his favorite Bank problem he showed signs of yielding.
Clay took the message as preliminary to surrender,
and his proverbial boldness rapidly grew to
arrogance. On the tariff, on the Bank, and on the
proposed nullification problems, he would give the
deciding word and that word was defiance.</p>

<p class="mid"><a href="images/085-large.jpg">Click to enlarge</a>, <a href="#MAPS">Click to return to Maps list</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, the cotton and tobacco interests
presented once more their demand for immediate
downward revision of the tariff, Clay and his more
ardent protectionists brushed aside the cautious
Adams and defied &ldquo;the South, the Democratic party,
and the Devil.&rdquo; The revision of the tariff which was
made in 1832 was no revision, save in a few unimportant
schedules in which the planters were not interested;
but the vote on this measure showed a
curious combination of the Jackson and the Clay</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

<p>politicians in the West and considerable indifference in
New England, as the accompanying map shows.
Having challenged Calhoun to do his worst, Clay
now pressed upon Jackson the question of renewing
the Bank charter. Under his instructions the president
of the Bank, Nicholas Biddle, a very able man,
hitherto inclining to settle matters with Jackson and
his friendly advisers, offered a memorial for a re-charter.
That is, the Bank men thought the President
of the United States was losing ground and
they would take their chances with the party of the
future. The Maysville veto was thought to have
weakened Jackson; he had lost the support of Calhoun
and had been compelled to reorganize his Cabinet;
on the tariff he had no opinions, and he had
done nothing to weld to him the Westerners. It
seemed a very simple matter, with the East behind
the brilliant Kentucky leader, to make the American
System the law of the land and to drive the Goths
and Vandals from the capital.</p>

<p>Mr. Clay had been nominated for the Presidency
by an enthusiastic convention of his followers in
December, 1831; and his friend William Wirt had
also been nominated three months earlier by the
Anti-Masons, who, it was supposed, would draw
supporters from the Democrats, especially in Virginia,
where Jackson had never won the approval of
the ablest leaders. Never did the outlook of a political
party seem so bright as when the plans of the
tariff and Bank men were being laid in the spring
of 1832. John Sargent, one of the directors of the
Bank and brother-in-law of Henry A. Wise, a shrewd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
politician of Virginia, was made candidate for the
Vice-Presidency; a large majority of the Senate was
committed to the renewal of the charter,&mdash;even the
Calhoun men agreed as to this,&mdash;and in the House
John Quincy Adams and George McDuffie led a
decided majority in the same direction. All the industrial
forces of the country were enlisted and well
organized. If there was any doubt that the old hero
would be re&euml;lected, there was none that the Bank
and the tariff groups would retain control of Congress.</p>

<p>If Jackson was less confident than his opponents,
he was not afraid. The effects of his &ldquo;Union, it-must-be-preserved&rdquo;
speech were becoming evident;
he gradually came to stand for the budding nationality
among the self-seeking groups who would have
their way or break up the Confederation. With the
large majority of the up-country of the Middle States
and South in favor of a tariff, even a high tariff, he
promptly accepted the proposed revision. Already
nominated by many of the States, his friends had no
difficulty in securing him a unanimous renomination
from the Democratic National Convention which
met in Baltimore late in May, 1832. Meanwhile
Van Buren had been appointed Minister to England.
After reaching his post, the Senate, to gratify Calhoun
as well as strike at the President, rejected the
nomination. The humiliated minister was now nominated
Vice-President and plainly marked by Jackson
as his successor.</p>

<p>When the votes of both houses were shown to be
decidedly for a continuation of the protective system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
as enacted in 1828, Calhoun and the planter party
gave every assurance that South Carolina, at least,
would resist. The President gave out no indications
of what his attitude would be, but the extreme
Southerners could not expect that Jackson would
support their contentions; nor could they think
Clay, if elected, would yield the very base of the
system on which he proposed to stand as President.
But as the tariff bill came to its final reading, it was
seen that even New England hesitated, and many
voted against the measure; many districts of the
Southern up-country gave their votes for the proposed
law. In the West most men favored the bill.
The tariff was, therefore, a local issue, and the test
must come on the Bank. The bill for a re-charter of
the National Bank reached the President on July 4.
It was considered most carefully, and doubtless the
desperate situation of the Administration was duly
canvassed. With every evidence of a strong Southern
secession from his party, with Clay and Webster
leading the solid ranks of the East, it did seem that
Jackson would fail if he vetoed the bill passed by
great majorities in both Senate and House.</p>

<p>On July 10 the veto message went to Congress.
Its contention about the constitutionality of the
Bank was not important, for it was not a question
of what was constitutional, but of sheer power. The
majority of the votes in the coming election was
what each side sought. Jackson appealed to the
West and South, urging that the Bank was a sectional
institution constantly drawing money to the
big cities of the East, or worse still, sending it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
England; that it was a monopoly which had given
millions of the people's money to a few men, and that
it was then proposed to continue that monopoly. So
certain were Clay and Biddle that they would defeat
the President that they circulated at the expense of
the Bank thirty thousand copies of this remarkable
document. Biddle declared that Jackson was like

&ldquo;a chained panther, biting the bars of his cage.&rdquo;
Webster and John Quincy Adams, taking counsel
of their hopes, declared that the old man in the
White House was in his dotage and at the end of
his career.</p>

<p>A remarkable campaign ensued. While South
Carolina prepared to put into effect its remedy of
state intervention, the West and the lower South
united, as in 1828, against the East. The gubernatorial
contest in Kentucky, which came in August,
showed that Clay had not regained his former hold
on that State. From midsummer to November every
effort was made to break the power of Jackson, but
to no avail. Without the planter support of the
older South the President proved stronger than he
had been four years before with it; the plain people
were now more of a unit than they had ever been
before, though many of their number still voted for
the industrial or planter interests. The outcome surprised
all parties. Jackson received 219 electoral
votes, while Clay received only 49. The popular
majority over all other candidates, including William
Wirt and John Floyd, for whom the Calhoun
party of South Carolina cast its vote, was more than
125,000. No President has since received such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
large proportion of the suffrages of the people. Only
one Western State, Kentucky, supported Henry
Clay; while Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York
gave Jackson larger majorities than ever. The alliance
of the West and the up-country held together
in spite of the untoward circumstances.</p>

<p>The significance of the election was that the President
could rely upon the people in a fight with
Congress; it was the first appeal to the country made
over the heads of the national legislature. To this
triumphant President, Calhoun and his ardent nullifiers
must refer their case; the Bank would also
have to reckon with a much stronger man than its
spokesmen had contemplated.</p>

<p>Without awaiting the results of the election, Calhoun,
Hayne, and their allies called South Carolina
into special convention to consider the state of the
Union. The nullification program was carried by safe
majorities, despite the most strenuous resistance on
the part of the minority who called themselves
Unionists. South Carolina now formally declared the
tariff laws of the United States suspended after
February 1, 1833, unless the Federal Government
gave some relief; and it was further declared that in
case no relief were accorded, and the national authority
should be enforced within the boundaries of their
State, war would immediately ensue. The new governor,
James Hamilton, and the legislature, which
might be called into extra session at any time, were
authorized to call out the militia, purchase arms,
and organize for the conflict.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jackson had been preparing for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
contest in the Southwest. In 1827-28 all the legislatures
of that region had declared the protective
tariff unconstitutional and some had threatened secession.
But after the election of 1828 these same
legislatures refused to concur in the doctrines of nullification
which South Carolina submitted to them.
The situation had changed. John Quincy Adams, the
New Englander, was President in 1828; Andrew
Jackson, the Westerner and the most popular man in
the country, was at the head of the Union in 1832.
Besides, Jackson was already moving the Indians
from the cotton lands, going so far as to acquiesce
in the flagrant nullification of the federal law by
the Georgia governor and legislature. The decision
of the Supreme Court in favor of the Cherokees, who
refused to surrender their lands, was publicly flouted
by the President. It was plain that the planters of
the Southwest would get what they wanted even
if they had to violate treaties of the Federal Government.
They refused to sustain South Carolina. Had
not the President carried every county in Alabama
and Mississippi in the recent election?</p>

<p>And in the older South the anti-national feeling
had wonderfully cooled since 1828. North Carolina
reversed her attitude; Tennessee would not consider
Calhoun's plan of bringing the Union to terms. In
Virginia the tobacco counties of the Piedmont section
united with the tidewater counties and made a
show of supporting South Carolina. New England
men who had as recently as 1820 declared the protective
system unconstitutional had no thought of maintaining
such a doctrine when advocated by Calhoun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, instead of a solid group of planter States,
South Carolina's proposed national referendum met
with almost unanimous opposition. Jackson had undermined
the party of Calhoun, which at the time of
the break-up of the Cabinet in 1831 seemed more
powerful in the South than any other. Jackson and
Van Buren had proved to be master politicians, and
when Congress met for the short session in December,
1832, it was plain that Calhoun was practically
alone and that the President would have to deal with
only one recalcitrant State.</p>

<p>From this vantage-ground, Jackson issued his
proclamation of December 10, in which he plainly
told South Carolina that the federal laws would be
enforced at the point of the bayonet, and that, furthermore,
the Union was an indissoluble nation, as
Webster and himself had declared; and he at the
same time urged upon Congress the so-called &ldquo;Force
Bill,&rdquo; granting him full power to punish all infractions
of the national revenue laws. And now for the
first time he expressed his real view that the tariff
was unjust. The Verplanck Bill to reduce the tariff
to a twenty-five per cent basis was the President's
confession that Calhoun had been right. The two
measures were pressed by the Administration, the
one strongly national and supported by a strong
majority, the other strongly Jacksonian and opposed
by most of the leaders who desired to see Calhoun
humiliated. It seemed almost certain, early
in 1833, that this program would be carried out to
the letter.</p>

<p>Such a victory for the Union forces and especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
for Jackson was too much for the opposition. Henry
Clay stopped in Philadelphia on his way to Washington
and held a conference there with the industrial
leaders of the Middle States. He went on to the
capital with a plan of his own. Its purpose was to
keep the control of things in the hands of the friends
of the American System and to deprive the President
of the prestige of settling the tariff and the
nullification problems at the same time. He held a
<i>carte blanche</i> from the leading protected interests to
do what he thought best. Webster and John Quincy
Adams hesitated. They urged the passage of the
&ldquo;Force Bill&rdquo; at once; but hoped to defeat the Verplanck
measure, its counterpart. Clay made overtures
to Calhoun, and Washington was surprised to
see the two great antagonists associating and planning
together, apparently in concert as of old when
they forced the War of 1812 upon an unwilling
President.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Force Bill&rdquo; was to be accepted by the Calhoun
men; but a new and final tariff measure was to take
the place of the one upon which Jackson had set his
heart. The famous compromise law of 1833 was the
result. This gave the planters a reduction to twenty
per cent, a lower rate than Jackson had offered, but the
reductions were to be made gradually during a period
of ten years, thus giving time for the industrial men
to readjust their affairs without great losses. There
was one joker in the scheme which the Southerners
seem to have winked at: that which exempted the
wool-growers of the Middle States and the West
from the reductions. The author of the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>

System now hotly urged the men who a year ago
would defy the &ldquo;South, the Democratic party, and the
Devil&rdquo; to undo all their work. On March 1, three
days before the close of the session, both the President's
&ldquo;Force Bill&rdquo; and Clay's compromise tariff
passed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile South Carolina, acting on Calhoun's
advice, had postponed the enforcement of her nullifying
ordinance, and now, as Congress adjourned,
the former Vice-President, ill and greatly discouraged,
hurried by rapid stages to Columbia to make
sure that the crisis should be brought to a peaceful
close. The convention was reassembled; an embassy
from Virginia was on the ground urging peace, and, as
was natural, the ordinance was repealed. The planters
had really won a victory and the rising industrial
groups understood this both at the time and later,
when they clamored for the restoration of their privileges.
The cotton and tobacco men, producing the
larger part of the national exports, had shown their
strength. Their opponents, the manufacturers and
the bankers of the East, with a much greater income,
were as yet not so strong as the planters. The
West and the South were their markets, and concessions
must be made; the Union was to them essential,
while to the South, selling its huge crops in European
markets, it was less important. As yet the
West, with its hero the master in Washington,
had obtained none of the reforms for which it had
so long striven. Benton and his friends looked to
the next Congress for results. Would they be disappointed?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p><i>The Messages and Papers of the Presidents</i> (1900), vol. <span class="smcap">II</span>, gives
Jackson's official statements. Bassett's and Parton's biographies,
already mentioned, are still very serviceable. There is no full
biography of Clay, but C. Colton's <i>The Private Life of Henry Clay</i>
contains some of Clay's letters. Carl Schurz's <i>Henry Clay</i> and T.
H. Clay's <i>Henry Clay</i>, already noted, offer some good information.
The best source for Calhoun is J. F. Jameson's <i>The Correspondence
of John C. Calhoun</i> (1899). G. Hunt's <i>Life of Calhoun</i> (1908), in

Study of Nullification</i>, already referred to, and W. E. Dodd's <i>Calhoun</i>,
in <i>Statesmen of the Old South</i> (1911), offer still further information
as to Calhoun and nullification. C. H. Van Tyne's <i>Letters of
Daniel Webster</i> (1902) supplies information about Webster which is
lacking in the older <i>Works</i> by Everett (1851) or F. Webster (1857).
H. C. Lodge's <i>Daniel Webster</i>, in <i>American Statesmen</i> series and
J. B. McMaster's <i>Daniel Webster</i> (1902) are the standard biographies.

the <i>American Statesmen</i>, and W. M. Meigs's <i>Thomas Hart Benton</i>,
in the <i>American Crises</i> series, are good brief portraits. William
McDonald's <i>The Jacksonian Democracy</i> (1906), in the <i>American

<h4>THE TRIUMPH OF JACKSON</h4>

<p>Before the great conflict between the manufacturers
and the planters had been brought to a lame
conclusion in the force bill and the tariff compromise
of 1833, so unsatisfactory to everybody, Jackson had
taken up the Bank problem, in which the West was
particularly interested. The annual message of 1832
indicated his intention to close up the business in accordance
with what seemed to him to be the decree
of the people. But while the President regarded an
election as settling the matter, it soon became clear
that Nicholas Biddle and the leaders of the United
States Senate were far from that opinion. Having
combined to defeat the &ldquo;old Indian scalper,&rdquo; as
Biddle was wont to term Jackson, in his plan to
bring South Carolina to terms, these able men continued
their operations to balk him on the Bank
question.</p>

<p>The Bank of the United States had a capital stock
of $35,000,000, its twenty-nine branches ramified
the commerce of the country, and its total volume of
business was about $70,000,000, or more than the
amount of the national exports each year. It practically
controlled the currency, and it could increase
or diminish the amount of money in circulation by
about one third at any time. Nicholas Biddle, a trained
financier and strong-willed aristocrat, who put little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
faith in popular elections and plebiscites, was the
head of the Bank, and all the presidents and directorates
of the subordinate banks were his appointees;
he controlled absolutely all the departments and all
the directors of the parent bank in Philadelphia, going
so far in 1833 as to deny the government directors
their lawful right to attend the board meetings.
There has never been another financial leader in the
United States who was so powerful or so much feared
as was Nicholas Biddle in 1833.</p>

<p>Both sides prepared for a renewal of the struggle
for or against a new charter. Jackson sent Secretary
of State Livingston as Minister to France early in
1833, and transferred Secretary McLane from the
Treasury to the State Department. It was known
that both Livingston and McLane opposed the President
in his plan of overthrowing the Bank, and this
shift was made to avoid another break-up of the
Cabinet and to enable Jackson to get a Secretary of
the Treasury who would support him. William J.
Duane, of Pennsylvania, accepted the vacant portfolio
in January, 1833, knowing well the President's
purpose, which was to withhold from the Bank the
federal deposits. Agents were sent out to ascertain
what state banks were in a condition to receive the
proposed government funds, and of course a strong
banking support was thus secured for the contemplated
policy.</p>

<p>Biddle laughed at Jackson's message of 1832
which denounced the Bank. He expected to receive
from Congress in due time the charter which the
President had denied. More than fifty members of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

that body, including Clay, Webster, George McDuffie,&mdash;Calhoun's
ally and the chairman of the
House Committee on Ways and Means,&mdash;and the
famous Davy Crockett, were borrowers from the
Bank on the easiest of terms. The greater newspaper
editors of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,
and Richmond were either opposed to the
President or on Biddle's list of beneficiaries; while
scores of hack writers all over the country received
their stipends from the &ldquo;Monster,&rdquo; as Jackson designated
the Bank. It might have been an easy matter
for Biddle and Clay to secure their charter from the
Congress which sat in its closing session in the winter
of 1833. But the great thing before them at that time
was the nullification-tariff problem, which threatened
civil war, and the friends of the Bank joined the
protectionists and, under Clay's deft leadership, as
we have seen, defeated Jackson's plan for tariff reform.
The short session drew to a close, and Biddle, Clay,
and Webster prepared for renewing their fight
when Congress came together in December.</p>

<p>When the lines began to tighten in the summer
of 1833, Duane weakened and finally refused to
withhold the government deposits from the Bank. He
was dismissed from office and Roger B. Taney, the
Attorney-General, took the vacant place and agreed
to do Jackson's bidding. From October 1, 1833, the
income of the Treasury was placed as it accrued in
the custody of the state banks which had been made
ready for the new policy. Jackson declared that the
National Bank had become unsafe and therefore an
unfit place for the keeping of $10,000,000 of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
people's money, the amount then on deposit. But the
real reason of the change was social and political.
The President desired to weaken the Bank, lest its
representatives, its masterful lobbyists, and the financial
pressure it was bringing to bear should wrest
from Congress a charter which the people had repudiated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Biddle had begun his campaign to compel
both Jackson and the people to yield. On August
1, two months before the Treasury began to
place its receipts in the state banks, Biddle ordered
a curtailment of the loans of the National Bank and
its branches. In the South and West, where large
sums were needed at that moment to move the cotton
and grain crops, the curtailment was double that
of the East. This led to immediate financial stringency;
National Bank notes, the standard money of
the time, became scarce; and gold or silver was absolutely
wanting. The state banks were naturally
forced to withhold their accustomed loans and the
anticipated government deposits could not be drawn
upon. Business failures became frequent and laborers
were discharged. It was a panic in the midst of prosperity.
The program was executed with callous heartlessness
by Biddle, and with the approval of men like
Clay and Webster, till Congress met in December.</p>

<p>The people were beginning to see what a power they
had attacked. Rates of interest rose from six to fifteen
per cent; farms and crops were sold under the sheriff's
hammer at absurdly low prices. The outlook was anything
but bright when the next annual message of
the President called upon the national legislature to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
aid him in his struggle. Petitions were pouring into
Washington by the thousand, and delegations of
business men appeared almost daily at the White
House, asking Jackson to restore the deposits and
surrender to the great corporation, thus acknowledging
the subordination of the country to one of its
interests.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances and awaiting confidently
the effect of the Bank's drastic pressure upon
public opinion, Clay began in January, 1834, the
work of compelling the President to restore the deposits.
For weeks and even months the Senate was
the scene of the most extraordinary denunciations,
and the press of the country was burdened with the
attacks and counter-attacks of the parties to this
fierce and unrelenting struggle. In the East business
failures, the closing of the doors of manufacturing
establishments, and the discharge of small
armies of employees furnished all the proof necessary
that the distress was real. From all sections of
the country cries of distress, memorials, and petitions
came up to Washington. Biddle and his
friends had no thought of relenting, but continued
the curtailment of the financial business of the
country far beyond what might have seemed necessary
on account of the removal of deposits; they
were certain that only a few months more of pressure
and of increased suffering on the part of the
people would compel Jackson to yield or Congress
to grant the desired charter over the head of the
President.</p>

<p>But the Congress which was elected in 1832 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
which sat from December, 1833, to March, 1835,
was not so pliable as that which arranged the peace
with South Carolina. Still, the Senate sustained the
Bank by a decided majority, and in March it formally
censured Jackson for his removal of the deposits.
In this Clay was conspicuous, and Webster
and Calhoun were his sympathetic allies. On the
other hand, Benton, Silas Wright, of New York,
and John Forsyth, of Georgia, made a most spirited
defense of Jackson and of the cause of the people,
as they insisted. In the House the situation was
reversed, and all Biddle's energy and resolute lobbying
failed to secure a favorable vote. It became
clear early in the spring that the President could
not be moved, and that impeachment, which had been
the hope and talk of many, would be impossible.
When the weight of public opinion inclined visibly
to the side of Jackson at the end of spring, Clay, who
had for some time doubted the loyalty of Biddle, and
who was especially anxious to regain his former popularity
in the West, refused to continue the fight;
Webster, too, lost interest and advised the directors
of the Bank that the cause was lost. Calhoun, who
had supported Clay and Webster to humiliate Jackson,
could not retreat; he was again isolated, and
he felt his position bitterly. McDuffie resigned his
seat and his chairmanship in the House in utter
disgust. To all but the president of the United
States Bank the case seemed hopeless when Congress
adjourned in early summer without passing any act
bearing on the situation. Biddle's remark in a letter
to a friend in Baltimore, "If the Bank charter were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
renewed or prolonged, I believe the pecuniary difficulties
of the country would be immediately healed,"
shows his attitude; and by this time the people
seem to have come to the conclusion that it was not
a war of Jackson upon the Bank so much as a war
of the Bank upon the country to compel the reissue
of a charter which was about to expire. Petitions
now poured into Biddle's office and delegations from
Middle States cities urged a change of the Bank's
policy; even Albert Gallatin, long a defender and
ardent friend, deserted Biddle. And at last, after
the nation's currency of some hundred millions
had been reduced by one third, and when money
rates in New York were running as high as twenty-four
per cent, the order went out to the branch
banks to suspend the stringent punitive measures in
order that &ldquo;We may save our beloved country from
the curse of Van Burenism,&rdquo; as one of the directors
described it.</p>

<p>The decline of the power of the Bank was now
rapid. In the state and congressional elections of
1834 the President of the United States was everywhere
sustained, even the Whigs quietly taking the
same ground. The friendship of the Bank was now
enough to damn any party; Biddle realized the danger
of his situation, and on election day sent his family
out of town and barricaded his house and office.
The legislatures of Pennsylvania and New York,
where his flag had flown triumphantly for years, denounced
him and planned to issue bonds for the
relief of the people. The autumn saw a complete
reversal of policy on the part of the Bank, and busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>ness
at once resumed its normal course. Money
became easy, prices rose to the former level, and the
wheels of industry began to turn. Nothing seemed
more conclusively shown than that most of the
trouble had been due to the demand on the part of
a few men for a continuation of financial privileges.</p>

<p>Jackson's first great victory was won, and he
would have been more than human not to have
shown his sense of triumph on the reassembling of
Congress at the end of the momentous year. The
Monster had been crushed; and all his great enemies&mdash;Clay,
Webster, Adams, and Calhoun&mdash;had
been beaten!</p>

<p>Before the first break in the Cabinet Jackson had
proved the value of direct and simple methods in
diplomacy. In colonial times and during the operation
of the Jay Treaty the West India trade was
most important. From New England and the Middle
States fish, lumber, grain, and other plantation
supplies had been sold to the West India planters
in great quantities. The war of the Revolution curtailed
this trade; that of 1812 practically destroyed
it, and England thereafter refused to allow American
shipping any rights in these possessions, though
Adams and Clay had urged the reciprocal benefits
of such a commerce.</p>

<p>The Jackson Administration succeeded in securing
almost immediately the desired trade arrangements,
and the shipping of the Chesapeake Bay, of
Boston and New York, took its wonted course. This
victory was hardly scored before the new President
secured from France formal treaty recognition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

the old spoliation claims arising from the depredations
of Napoleon I, which no former administration
had been able to collect. In 1831 the Government
of Louis Philippe agreed to pay these damages to the
amount of 25,000,000 francs. But the French legislature
delayed to vote the necessary appropriations.
Jackson, assuming that the obligations would
be met promptly, drew upon the French treasury
for the first installment and asked the National
Bank to collect the bills&mdash;somewhat over $900,000.
The papers were duly presented in Paris, but they
were dishonored. This happened in 1833, when the
Bank was in the midst of the fight on the President.
Biddle, without hesitation, charged the Government
$15,000 for the damage to the reputation of the
Bank because the draft had been dishonored in Paris.
The Government refused to pay the claim, and a
lawsuit of ten years followed which was finally decided
against the Bank.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Jackson, preparing
for the removal of the deposits, sent Secretary
Livingston to France to urge the execution of the
treaty of 1831. Livingston failed to convince the
French assembly that it was necessary either to pay
the overdue claims or to execute certain reciprocity
clauses of the treaty. In December, 1834, when
the Bank crisis had passed, the President sent to
Congress a message which asked for the passage of
an act authorizing reprisals on French shipping or
other property. Such a warlike proposition, with
the explanation which accompanied it, aroused the
country. In commercial centers there was great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
excitement, and insurance companies changed their
contracts in expectation of war.</p>

<p>Once more the President was opposed and denounced
in the Senate as a reckless Executive who
would rush headlong into war. But the treaty with
France authorized just such procedure as had been
suggested, and only recently France had taken the
same course with other countries. It soon became
so clear that Jackson was within his rights and that
the country was behind him, that resolutions were
suffered to pass the Senate virtually approving this
part of the message. In the House the vote indorsing
the Executive was unanimous, though it was not
thought advisable to do more than this until there
had been ample time for reconsideration of the subject
in France.</p>

<p>The strong language of the President aroused a
storm of criticism in France, and for a time war was
threatened. The French Minister in Washington
was recalled, and of course the diplomatic representative
of the United States in Paris was withdrawn.
The conservative press of Europe made this another
occasion for ridiculing the Yankee Republic, whose
money-making propensities should be curtailed and
whose gaudy wares and vulgar rocking-chairs should
be tabooed everywhere. &ldquo;Let the French navy sweep
the Atlantic Ocean of their ships and again take possession
of Louisiana&rdquo; was the unfriendly advice of
certain English journals. Before the summer of 1835
closed, all relations between France and the United
States had ceased, though actual war was not expected.
When Congress met, Jackson reviewed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

situation in a calm manner and gave every opportunity
for the reopening of negotiations, though warlike
preparations were recommended to meet those
of France. But England tendered her friendly offices,
and the difficulty was promptly brought to a satisfactory
conclusion by the payment of the indemnity
so long due.</p>

<p>More interesting and more important to the West
and South was the stern and persistent policy of
Jackson in removing the Indians from their fertile
lands. From Michigan the natives were pushed into
Wisconsin and Illinois, where they rested a few short
years, only to be driven in 1833 beyond the Mississippi
to the western parts of Iowa and Minnesota,
against the heroic struggles of Black Hawk and a
handful of followers. From the lower South the
Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws were
gradually removed during the years 1830 to 1838,
sometimes after the most shameless and brutal treatment
by the representatives of both the States and
the Nation. Before Jackson came to office the Creeks
of western Georgia had been browbeaten into sales
of their lands and then removed to the region beyond
Arkansas, to be known thereafter as the Indian
Territory. In 1833 to 1835 the Choctaws and Chickasaws
of Mississippi were defrauded of their best
lands and carried forcibly to the new Indian country;
but the most arbitrary part of the governmental
policy was the expulsion of the Cherokees from their
beautiful hills in northern Georgia. Thirteen thousand
in number, civilized and devotedly attached to
their homes, these people insisted on remaining and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
becoming a State to themselves. Under the
leadership of John Ross, they presented the case to the United States Supreme
Court, which decided in 1830 that they composed a nation and that they could not
lawfully be compelled to submit to Georgia. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>

people of Georgia would not for a moment consider
such a proposition, and moreover they had made up
their minds that the Cherokees must likewise give
up their lands and migrate to the Far West. Jackson
took this view, and in December, 1835, he made
a treaty with some of the chiefs whereby the Cherokees
were to receive new lands in the Indian Territory
and more than five millions in money. This treaty was
at once denounced and repudiated by the majority
of the Indians, but the government agents executed
it, and during the next three years the helpless natives
were hunted down and carried, all save a small
remnant, to the new region. Thus President Monroe's
plan of settling the natives beyond the western
frontier in Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, and what is
now Oklahoma, was worked out, and the land-hungry
Western settlers were fast following them into their
distant homes; but practically all the lands east of
the great river were open to settlement, and Wisconsin,
Illinois, Alabama, and Mississippi rapidly became
populous communities.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> No measure of Jackson's
Administration won him greater popularity than that
of the removal of the Indians.</p>

<p>With the tariff question &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; settled, the
internal improvements demands temporarily in abeyance,
the Bank &ldquo;out of the way,&rdquo; and with a growing
prestige both at home and abroad, Jackson might now
have formulated the other Western ideals, free homesteads,
the re-claiming of Texas, and the occupation
of Oregon. But this was all left to Van Buren, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
man already practically chosen to carry forward the
policies of the &ldquo;old hero.&rdquo; However, without a free
homestead law or even a pre&euml;mption system, on which
Benton had long insisted, the West was filling up
with people in an unprecedented manner. The population
of Alabama was only a little more than a hundred
thousand in 1820; in 1835, it was not less than
half a million. Mississippi counted seventy-five thousand
in 1820; in 1840, its population had increased
sixfold. The same story was told by the statistics of
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa.
There was life, vigor, and rapid growth in all the
accessible parts of the region which worshiped the
President. Jackson's election was an advertisement
of the West; the long debates in Congress about
checking emigration to the Mississippi Valley increased
the desire to go to the new and happy country;
and the hard times of 1833-34 set thousands of
men upon the highways leading to the promised land.
And in the Western States every effort was made
to attract people. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois built
waterways which should feed the Mississippi or Erie
Canal commerce, and thus make Western life profitable
as well as free and unconventional. Where
canals could not be constructed would go the great
government road, passing through Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois, and its state-built branches. Even railroads
were projected in that far-off country. In the
Southwest the network of rivers offered transportation
facilities to the increasing crops of cotton, and
ambitious men flocked there to &ldquo;make fortunes in a
day.&rdquo; Sargent Prentiss, the poor New England crip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ple,
went to Mississippi about 1830, and in six years
he was both rich and famous; John A. Quitman, the
preacher's son, of New York, worked his way about
the same time to the lower Mississippi country, and
in a few years was receiving an annual income of
forty thousand dollars. John Slidell left New York
City a bankrupt in 1819, but soon became a great
lawyer and slave-owner in New Orleans.</p>

<p>The yearly migration of thousands of Eastern men
to the valley of the Mississippi was still further augmented
by streams of refugees from the unsettled
and distressed conditions of Germany. In Ohio,
Kentucky, southern Illinois, and Missouri these
idealistic emigrants from Europe found new homes
and substantial encouragement. They sent glowing
accounts of the new world to their friends at home,
and the tide of immigration which was destined to
enrich American life steadily increased. All this
stimulated speculation in Western lands, in canal
and banking ventures. The Government sales of
lands rose from $4,837,000 in 1834 to $24,000,000
in 1836. And the canal schemes of Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois found financial support in New York
and in London. No wonder the eastern manufacturers
sometimes desired to close the roads that
crossed the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing succeeds like success&rdquo; is an American
saying which applies admirably to Jackson's second
administration. The Western President had won
all his great contests; Calhoun and the radical
South had been tamed; Clay and Webster were
dragged behind his car of state; the National Bank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
was rapidly passing from the political stage; and
the tariff was no longer a troublesome factor in public
life. The receipts of the Treasury had steadily
outrun the expenses, and in 1834 the last of the national
debt was paid. Since the income was almost
certain to continue great, Jackson was at a loss what
to do. Henry Clay urged a simple distribution among
the States. The President feared the effect of this,
and vetoed a bill to that effect; he even proposed
that the Federal Government should buy stock in
all the railway corporations in order that these growing
monopolies be duly restrained. After two years
of disagreement a law was enacted which offered to
deposit the surplus with the States without interest
charges, but subject to recall. The States hastened
to make the necessary arrangements, and during the
second half of 1836 and the first quarter of 1837
more than $18,000,000 were thus deposited.</p>

<p>The land speculations, already at fever heat in the
West, the building of railways and canals, and the
prospective distribution of millions of the public
money warned the wise that sail must be taken in,
else disaster would ensue. Jackson, therefore, issued
an executive order in July, 1836, requiring the land
offices to accept only specie in payment for lands;
but it was not thought that this would occasion any
great distress. The people seemed to be satisfied
with the &ldquo;reign&rdquo; of Andrew Jackson, and it might
have been expected that he would have little difficulty
in placing his friend Van Buren in the high
office so soon to be vacated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>It did not prove so easy as it seemed. Calhoun and his followers were still hostile. In Tennessee,
Hugh Lawson White was heading a serious revolt
against Jackson and all his party, and of course
New England was still dissatisfied. Since the great
fight between the President and the Bank in 1833-34,
Henry Clay had been welding together all the forces
of the opposition. States-rights men in the South,
like John Tyler, of Virginia, and William C. Preston,
of South Carolina, the conservative forces in the
Middle States who were connected with banking and
&ldquo;big business,&rdquo; and the internal improvements forces
of the West that were still discontented, were all
united in a more or less cohesive party of opposition.
A platform they could not risk; in fact, platforms
were not as yet necessary for election, nor was it
thought best to nominate a single pair of candidates
and submit their case to the country. The Whigs,
as the opposition now came to be called, arranged a
ticket which Daniel Webster led in the East, which
William Henry Harrison, a popular military hero
of the Northwest, headed in that section, and which
Hugh Lawson White, a Jackson man till 1834,
championed in the Southwest. There followed a four-cornered
contest which resulted in the choice of Van
Buren by a popular majority of less than 30,000.
Van Buren carried more of the New England States
than did Webster and more of the South than did
White, but he lost most of the West, even Tennessee,
which had been the stronghold of his party.
The counties of the old South where Jackson had
been most feared gave their votes to Van Buren, the
&ldquo;safe and sane&rdquo;; and many New England and Mid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>dle
States manufacturers preferred to take their
chances with a masterful organizer of conservative
temper, who had been the balance wheel of the
Jackson Administration, to risking all in an election
in the House of Representatives, where the sections
would be fighting fiercely for political and party advantages.
The new r&eacute;gime of 1829 was thus about
to be turned into a reaction. There was a common
feeling that Van Buren would do nothing &ldquo;radical.&rdquo;

Even Calhoun thought better of the President-elect
than he thought of the &ldquo;old hero,&rdquo; and the first six
months of the new Administration had not passed
before he gave the President his support.</p>

<p>The political sun of Jackson went down brightly,
not a cloud on the horizon; and his chosen successor
declared openly in his inaugural that he would gladly
follow in &ldquo;the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor.&rdquo;
The country was still prosperous and the
wheels of industry were running at full speed. Foreign
Governments looked on with envy as the young
Western Republic stretched her limbs and rose to
gigantic proportions.</p>

<h4>DISTRESS AND REACTION</h4>

<p>Martin Van Buren came to office without the
enthusiastic support of any large segment of public
opinion. The machine forces of the time and the
hearty recommendation of Andrew Jackson had been
responsible for his elevation. His position was very
much like that of John Quincy Adams in 1825. If
the East had preferred him to his predecessor, it
was not because the East proposed to surrender any
of her interests; and if the West liked him less than
she had liked her hero, it was just because his feelings
and interests were suspected.</p>

<p>He had supported Jackson in the breaking-down
of a stable civil service in 1829, in order to ruin
their common opponents, Adams and Clay. Now
Van Buren was to inherit the evils of the spoils system,
and Adams, Clay, and Webster were leading
the attack upon him both in Congress and in the
country. Jackson's collector of the customs in New
York defaulted in the sum of $1,250,000 during the
first year of Van Buren's term; and to make matters
worse the new appointee behaved quite as scandalously
the next year. Out of sixty-seven land officers
in the West and South, sixty-four were reported
in 1837 as defaulters, and the United States Treasury
lost nearly a million dollars on their account.
The Jacksonian Democracy was certainly putting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

its worst foot foremost, and the great leaders of the
opposition held up their hands in horror at a system
which &ldquo;reeked with corruption from center to circumference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Van Buren had begun badly. But worse was to
follow. The receipts from federal land sales dropped
from $24,000,000 in 1836 to $6,000,000 in 1837,
and the total income of the Government declined
from $50,000,000 to $24,000,000 in the same year;
and the expenditures of the Treasury outran the receipts
during 1837 and 1838 by more than $21,000,000.
A deficit of $300,000,000 for two successive
years in our time would not be worse than the
deficit of the unpopular successor of Andrew Jackson.
From 1833 to 1836 there had been an annual
surplus equal sometimes to the total expense of the
Government. The national debt had been paid in
full and money had been loaned to the States without
interest or security. There was to be no more
national debt and no more paying of interest to
hard-driving capitalists; but Van Buren borrowed
$34,000,000 in two years to meet the ordinary expenses
of his Administration.</p>

<p>The honors of the time were, and have since been,
bestowed upon Jackson, and all the blame of things
was, and has since been, laid upon the shoulders of
Van Buren. But the fault was not Van Buren's. A
number of causes had produced this surprising and
distressing state of affairs. After the great success
of the Erie and other canals in the East, Western
States entered upon an era of canal building which
the richest of communities could ill have borne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Railroads were beginning to create markets for Eastern
farmers. The Westerners, therefore, sunk millions
of their hard earnings in railways which
paralleled their canals or projected into wildernesses.
Between 1830 and 1840 these ventures of
the West, from Michigan to Louisiana, absorbed
hundreds of millions of capital. Illinois borrowed
$14,000,000 when her total annual income was hardly
more than $250,000; Mississippi borrowed $12,000,000
on a yearly income a little less than that of
Illinois. The States had mortgaged their futures for
decades to come. This was especially true of Western
communities; but Eastern States like Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and South Carolina were also in
debt for similar amounts. Everybody thought the
resources of the United States were inexhaustible;
and everybody seemed willing to tax future generations
beyond all precedent in order to develop these
resources.</p>

<p>The depositing of the federal funds in state
banks by Jackson had greatly stimulated speculation.
Public interest in banks, already great, increased
enormously. Forty new banks were created
in Pennsylvania in a single year. State banks increased
their capital and extended their operations.
In two years the bank notes in circulation increased
from $95,000,000 to $140,000,000; loans and discounts
rose from $324,000,000 to $457,000,000.
The National Bank, which had curtailed business in
order to embarrass the country and particularly
President Jackson, quickly changed its tactics, and,
sailing under a charter from the State of Pennsyl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>vania,
kept pace with its five hundred rivals. To be
sure the Federal Constitution forbade the States to
issue bills of credit. But the States incorporated
banking companies which issued the forbidden notes
by the million, and the Supreme Court of the United
States, now that Marshall was dead and the personnel
of its membership had undergone a change,
declared the practice lawful.</p>

<p>States indorsed or participated in the proceedings
of the banks, the banks loaned to other corporations
or to private individuals on such security as land,
slaves, improvements already made, or the personal
credit of men otherwise deeply in debt. The flood
of money was thus, before 1837, invested in lands
and houses or railroads and canals which could
neither pay dividends nor return the principal for
several years. It seemed that when the Federal Government
paid the last of its debt, the States eagerly
pursued the opposite principle and created the
greatest debts possible.</p>

<p>Though the people of the United States joined in
all these wild ventures, they were not solely responsible.
Europe, especially England, had been
anxious to lend. The Erie Canal had been built upon
borrowed capital, and it had paid good dividends.
The old National Bank, now going out of business,
had placed $25,000,000 of its stock in Europe, and
the holders had received most liberal returns. American
investments were quoted as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; by the
Baring Brothers of London to their thousands of
customers. And why not? The Federal Government
had recently paid the last dollar of its two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
huge debts, more than $80,000,000 for the cost of
the Revolution and $110,000,000 for the cost of the
War of 1812, and the rate of interest had often
been as high as eight per cent. Was there a similar
example in all history? The bad reputation of
1783-1800 for debt-paying had been lived down.</p>

<p>Van Buren estimated the amount of money due
by States and corporations to English creditors at
$200,000,000. His estimate was probably not greatly
exaggerated. Certainly as much as $12,000,000 in
interest was due each year to English creditors.
The merchants of the great towns regularly bought
their goods on long time, sold them on time to the
shopkeepers of the villages and hamlets, and these
in turn sold on credit to their customers. Not less
than $100,000,000 was thus distributed over the
country. It was due any day in London or Liverpool.
The world seemed to &ldquo;take stock&rdquo; in the
new Republic, particularly when the returns were
large and prompt in appearing. And now that the
Federal Government was not a borrower, the States
became the heirs of the confidence of the capitalists
who, not comprehending the difference between the
National and the State Governments in the United
States, expected that the authorities in Washington
would bring due pressure to bear on local authorities
that might turn indifferent when crops were
bad.</p>

<p>All these things led to an inflated state of things.
Jackson had seen the dangerous tendency, and his
specie circular had been applied in 1836 in the
hope of mending matters. But the people who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
bought lands had no gold or silver. The effect of
the circular was to compel Western bankers to
call on their Eastern correspondents for metallic
money. All the specie in the Eastern vaults
amounted to only $19,000,000, a sum not in excess
of what it had been twenty years before, when the
paper money in circulation was not half so great.
Just as the West asked for more hard money English
bankers and other business men called sharply
for payment of outstanding debts due by leading
business men in the East. Both demands could not
be met at the same time. The bubble had been
pricked.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the wheat crop of the
Middle States and of the South failed utterly, and
the farmers were compelled to import grain on credit
for the next year's seeding. The cotton output was
large, but the price fell from twenty to ten cents a
pound. Corn and meat were plentiful in the West;
the means of transportation were, however, lacking.
There was famine and plenty in the land at the same
time. Business came to a standstill, all forward
movements stopped, and the banks closed their doors.</p>

<p>From a winter of greatest plenty and most amazing
expectations the people, particularly the poor of the
cities and mill towns, passed into a summer and autumn
of positive want and starvation. With flour at
twelve dollars a barrel, the New York price, and with
wages declining every day or industrial operations
suspended altogether, the lot of the worker was hard.
Riots were of weekly occurrence, and the greatest
business houses of New York, Philadelphia, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
New Orleans, where cotton was expected to save men,
declared themselves bankrupt and closed their doors.
Men who had clamored against Jackson or Biddle in
the time of distress three years before now looked
upon that crisis as only a flurry. Everything seemed
out of joint and the future gave no assurance of
speedy recovery. The East, which had condemned
the West for their stay laws against the panic of
1819, now clamored for a federal stay law and urged
Van Buren to suspend the specie circular. The President
refused to offer any relief, and other failures
and other risks followed. Before the summer had
well begun every bank in the country suspended
specie payment, and a little later local business men's
associations issued notes or due bills in small denominations
which were accepted as money. East,
South, and West the commercial and financial panic
held the country fast in its grip. Speculations fell
flat, obligations were void, and men turned to the
simpler forms of life to regain their equilibrium.
Barter took the place of former methods of exchange.</p>

<p>People blamed the banks; some cried out that the
monopolistic methods of business had been the cause.
The Whigs maintained that the panic and distress
were due to the blunders and crimes of the party in
power. Benton in reply declared that the paper
money and stock-jobbing systems of the last few
years had been the cause. Van Buren called Congress
together in extra session in September, 1837,
in order, as he said, to devise means of saving the
Government itself from bankruptcy. But he could not
place the blame on the preceding Administration, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>

his opponents delighted to do; he only said it was
all because of &ldquo;over-action in all departments of
business.&rdquo; Congress suspended the distribution of the
surplus revenue among the States, issued notes to the
amount of ten million dollars to meet the obligations
of the Government, and took measures for the safety
of the public funds in banks which could not pay
their debts. Gradually during the next year the signs
of recovery appeared. Rise of prices in Europe, a
good cotton crop, and the passing of the panicky
state of mind enabled the banks to resume specie
payments, and the mills of the East to open their
doors. But the public was in doubt whether the ruin
of the National Bank, the issuing of the specie circular
by Jackson, or the lack of ability on the part
of Van Buren had been the cause of the calamities
of the year 1837. And as it took years for men and
business houses to regain their former mutual confidence,
there was soreness and hesitation everywhere
until after 1840.</p>

<p>The financial situation was, therefore, the one
thing with which Van Buren had to deal during most
of his term. After the emergency measures had
passed, he gave earnest attention to the enacting of
a law which would create responsible agencies in the
larger cities for the receipt and expenditure of the
public moneys. The purpose was to avoid concentration
and monopoly such as the National Bank had
maintained, and to keep the control of the finances in
the hands of the Government. It was called the Independent
Treasury system. The President pressed
the measure before a divided Congress and without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the support of any concerted or strong public opinion.
To the surprise of many, Calhoun, the bitterest
of his enemies, came to his assistance. This meant the
support of most of the cotton and tobacco planters.
Yet the measure failed of passage during the sessions
of 1837-38 and 1838-39.</p>

<p>Van Buren did not know how to appeal to the
popular heart when powerful congressional leaders
and shrewd business men pressed too hard. He simply
adhered to his Independent Treasury Bill against
all opposition, fair and unfair. A group of conservative
Democrats broke away from his leadership in
1838 and deprived him of a majority; in the next
Congress he was no stronger, and the one measure
of reform which he urged failed to pass before June,
1840. Another legacy of Jackson, his &ldquo;illustrious
predecessor,&rdquo; was a war with the Seminole Indians,
who resisted removal to the western frontier; and
before 1842 the suppression of these desperate natives
and their slave allies, runaways from the Georgia
plantations, cost the Government $40,000,000,
most of which had to be borrowed at high rates of
interest.</p>

<p>Even more threatening than the Seminole troubles
was the Texas problem. The last act of Jackson's
official life was to recognize the independence of that
aspiring State. But this was only preliminary to the
real purposes of Texas and her agents, who pressed
Van Buren in the summer of 1837 for annexation to
the United States; though these same agents wrote
home that if annexation did not succeed, the South
would break away from the Union, and that if it did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
succeed, the North would withdraw from the federal
compact. So that while Calhoun and his friends
aided the President in his financial measures, they at
the same time importuned him to help the South by
adding another pro-slavery State to the Union. This
was not the first time this question had embarrassed
a president. As already seen, Clay had denounced
Monroe for giving away that princely domain; Benton
and Van Buren had warred upon Adams and
Clay in 1826-28 for not compelling a restoration,
and under this pressure and that of the South in general,
Adams had sought in vain to purchase Texas;
under Jackson the problem was several times taken
up, and as much as $5,000,000 was offered. Still the
astute General had steered clear of trouble when annexation
&ldquo;with war&rdquo; was offered in 1836.</p>

<p>Van Buren likewise delayed and risked his Southern
popularity. Meanwhile a revolt against the British
Government broke out in Canada, and thousands
of Americans along the border, from Maine to Wisconsin,
lent open assistance to their &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo;
neighbors. Van Buren remained strictly neutral.
With much difficulty was the peace maintained, and
at the expense of many savage attacks upon the Administration
for its un-American policy and lack of
sympathy with men who fought for &ldquo;freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the President was seeking to reform the
national currency and restrain the imperialistic tendencies
of his countrymen, one great State, New
York, under the leadership of Silas Wright, was
showing the country what could be done locally to
make banking safe. In 1829 a law was enacted com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>pelling
every newly chartered bank to contribute a
certain percentage of its income to a common safety
fund. The disasters of 1837 showed these reserves to
be too small, and in 1839 every bank in the State
was required to deposit with the Treasury securities
enough to protect all notes to be put into circulation.
At the same time any group of capitalists who
would conform to the law might open a bank without
let or hindrance, which had the effect of putting
financial operations on simple business principles,
removing the political motive which had wrought so
much damage to innocent depositors. During the
next decade the New York example had great influence,
and Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina,
and other older States instituted safe and conservative
banking systems.</p>

<p>But while these communities learned slowly the
lesson of careful finance, Michigan, Mississippi, and
other States, East and West, hard pressed by their
circumstances and the overwhelming debts which
they piled up till about 1840, repudiated or failed to
meet their obligations. And when suits were brought
by domestic or foreign creditors, state legislatures
simply declined to pay and claimed immunity from
federal pressure under the Eleventh Amendment to
the National Constitution. Nor were the resources
of the Western communities equal to the discharge
of their onerous burdens. To have attempted to force
upon the people the payment of the debts their leaders
had fixed upon them would have caused wholesale
migrations to Wisconsin, Iowa, and Texas. The people
of the West, of the country as a whole, perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
were still in the position of frontiersmen as compared
to Europeans. They needed all the time more capital
than they could repay in many years, and they
were not as yet disciplined to the point of bearing
heavy burdens.</p>

<p>With so much distress in the country and with
the Administration overburdened with problems,
Clay, Adams, and Webster organized the opposition
in Congress and throughout the country very
much as Van Buren, Calhoun, and Jackson had done
in 1826-28. The President, they said, was no friend
of the people; he had not so much as mentioned their
case in his messages to Congress. He was likened
to a sea captain who seizes the lifeboats on a distressed
ship in midocean and, saving himself and
crew, leaves the passengers to the mercies of the angry
waves. Clay said the panic had been due entirely
to the ungodly Jackson and his foolish successor;
Webster saw the sole cause of the ills of the time
in the foolhardy policy of the last half-dozen years.
John Quincy Adams never tired of ridiculing the
puerile maneuvers of backwoods politicians whose
ignorance amounted almost to high crime. To him
the Independent Treasury Bill was an attempt to
separate the Government from business, as futile as
to try to divorce the law from the judges in the administration
of justice.</p>

<p>Business men were appealed to to help avert the
further catastrophes which a Democratic Administration
would surely inflict. Distressed planters were
reminded of the low price of cotton, all the friends
of the former National Bank were told to remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>

the war on the Bank which had ruined them and the
country at the same time. Indignation meetings were
held in the East to denounce Van Buren and the
&ldquo;Loco-focos,&rdquo; a term of reproach applied generally to
the party in power; Henry Clay made a tour of the
Eastern States thanking God that he had been
spared to help in undoing the work of Jackson;
Webster canvassed the West in the hope of restoring
the minds of the people to their wonted sanity and a
renewal of the alliance of West and East, on which
alone depended the prospect of good government in
the United States. The Whig party was now a powerful
machine, and its leaders would take the people
into their confidence. &ldquo;The honesty of plain men&rdquo;
became a favorite expression of the time; and
Adams, Clay, and Webster repeated the experiment
of Jackson, Calhoun, and Benton in 1828, in a four-year
campaign against Van Buren. A disinterested
philosopher might have said that it was poetic justice
for the persecuted Adams of 1828 to appear in
the r&ocirc;le of persecutor in 1840.</p>

<p>Though the President was an abler politician than
Adams had been in the former struggle, he was
hardly able to parry the blows of Clay and his Eastern
allies, especially after the elections of 1838, when
both houses of Congress were lost to the Administration.
Calhoun, Benton, and Silas Wright made a
strong fight on behalf of the Democrats. To the Independent
Treasury measure they added the pre&euml;mption
and graduation bills, which commanded almost
unanimous support in the West, and at last secured
the passage of all three in June, 1840. Though Clay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and his party waged a powerful opposition through
four full years, they had no definite program to offer.
The groups of their organization were as yet poorly
knit together. Their popular appeal was &ldquo;to drive the
Goths and Vandals&rdquo; from the capital. The &ldquo;new
Napoleon and his minions,&rdquo; according to another
historical comparison, must give way to the old r&eacute;gime,
to gentlemen &ldquo;who knew how to govern.&rdquo; And
consequently the new alignments were much the
same as those which had supported Adams and Clay
in 1828, the South and West uniting on the &ldquo;reform&rdquo;

Treasury system and Benton's land bills,
while the East and certain conservative elements of
the West and South indorsed, tentatively, at least,
the &ldquo;American System,&rdquo; or at least lent willing ears
to the eloquence of Clay.</p>

<p>Still the people hardly knew whom to believe, and
they grouped themselves in the different States in a
way which seemed unlike the earlier combinations.
Thick-and-thin followers of Van Buren called themselves
Democrats and insisted that they were the disciples
of Thomas Jefferson; the organizers of the
opposition to Jackson in his war on the Bank had
claimed to be National Republicans, though they accepted
with pride the name of Whigs after 1836.
They asserted also that they were the followers of
the great Virginia democrat; perhaps the historian
would be compelled to deny that either faction was
democratic.</p>

<p>As the Democrats were almost unanimously in
favor of the renomination of Van Buren, it was not
difficult to manage their convention of that year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Nor was the platform the occasion of any serious
disagreement. It stated for the first time that the
party was opposed to internal improvements, a protective
tariff, and the assumption of the debts of
bankrupt States. In all these the West was much
interested. But on the subject of slavery it was definitely
declared that the Federal Government had no
power of interference. For the last time in the history
of the <i>ante-bellum</i> Democracy, the Declaration
of Independence was declared to be an item of the
party faith. Van Buren took many risks in this un-Western
program; though the panic of 1837 was
doubtless his heaviest burden, as the Whigs never
tired of asserting and repeating.</p>

<p>The Whigs met in convention at Harrisburg in
December, 1839. Divided on the great questions of
the day, they feared to nominate their one masterful
leader, and in weak imitation of the Jackson men of
1828 turned to William Henry Harrison, a frontier
general of no great ability or reputation. John Tyler,
a Virginia politician of the Calhoun school, was
made the candidate for the Vice-Presidency. On the
matter of a program it was impossible for the Whig
groups to agree, and consequently they offered no
platform at all. But the West received notice from
the leaders that in the event of success, the debts of
their States would be laid upon the broad shoulders
of the Union and that internal improvements would
be resumed. In the East the restoration of the
National Bank and the renewal of the high tariff
schedules of 1832 were the assurances of men like
Webster and Clay. With differences so great divid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ing
the opposition it was impossible to make a campaign
on the issues of the time, serious as these
were acknowledged to be.</p>

<p>The contest which followed was unlike any other
in the history of the Union. &ldquo;Hard cider,&rdquo; &ldquo;coon
skins,&rdquo; and &ldquo;log cabins&rdquo; became the slogans of the
campaign, because once in his life General Harrison
had lived in a cabin and &ldquo;drunk the beverage of
the common people.&rdquo; Van Buren could not meet
such cries. His canvass became a defense, and his
followers half acknowledged their defeat when it
was seen that the West rallied to Harrison. The
plain citizen was carried off his feet, and he voted
against the man in the White House who was said
to use gold and silver on his table and dress himself
before costly French mirrors. Nor was he certain in
his more serious vein whether after all Jackson had
not made a sad blunder in choosing the New York
politician to carry out his policies. Without real argument
or any serious presentation of the issues the
Whigs, appealing to what were considered Western
prejudices, built log cabins on the public squares,
wore coonskin caps, and sang Van Buren out of
office to the tune of &ldquo;Typ and Ty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Little Van is
a used-up man,&rdquo; and other like vanities.</p>

<p>The result was an overwhelming victory for Harrison
and Tyler, the President carrying only one
New England State and Virginia, South Carolina,
Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, and Illinois, and receiving
only sixty electoral votes out of a total of
294. The popular vote was 2,400,000, almost twice
as great as in any previous election. The people were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
learning to vote if nothing more. Van Buren and
his lieutenants, including Calhoun, were chagrined
and humiliated. The West had returned the enemies
of Jackson to power and, perhaps unintentionally,
had written failure across the work of their
&ldquo;hero.&rdquo; Thus Clay had turned the backwoodsmen
and their methods against the original backwoods
statesman, and brought about a restoration of the
old r&eacute;gime. Nicholas Biddle and all his financial
friends rejoiced. Webster and New England looked
once again to a new era of protection; and the internal
improvements men of the West and the up-country,
having been overwhelmed by the panic in
their various State undertakings, turned their expectations
once more toward the National Treasury.
The manufacturing and the financial interests had
in reality come into control again, and with the
assistance of the plain people of the back-country.
Clay had been the architect of the new structure,
while Jackson and Calhoun mourned alike the defeat
of Van Buren.</p>

<h4>THE MILITANT SOUTH</h4>

<p>William Henry Harrison and the Whig party
came to power in 1841 without a program. The men
who had driven Martin Van Buren from office in
1840 were in as much doubt what to do for the
country as the Jackson men had been in 1829. Clay
had said during the campaign that he might restore
the United States Bank, and he had said he might
not do so; the Eastern Whigs had declared for a
higher tariff in 1842, when the compromise of 1833
would expire, while the Southern Whigs had denied
that such a move would be made; the Western
men who had deserted Van Buren for a log-cabin
leader demanded now as ever internal improvements,
though their Southern allies bitterly opposed all such
propositions. With counsels so divided Harrison
turned readily to Henry Clay, who shaped the inaugural
and filled the Cabinet with his political friends.
Congress was called in extra session for the last of
May, 1841, when an improvised plan of action would
be offered and perhaps enacted into law. The main
items were to be a new National Bank, a higher
tariff, and the distribution among the States of the
proceeds of the public land sales. This would enable
States to construct their own public improvements
and at the same time avoid a rupture between
Southern and Western Whigs. Thus the chief items<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of the old Clay and Adams &ldquo;American System&rdquo; was
to be re&euml;nacted by a Congress whose majority was
none too large and more than heterogeneous in character.</p>

<p>But before the national legislature met, the President
had died and John Tyler had become the head
of the Administration. Virginia politics were at that
time and long after dominated by a state banking
system, and both Virginia and the lower South opposed
all forms of tariff protection. The new President
had been nominated by the Whigs in spite of
his political views, and only in the hope that he might
carry his State, in which they had been disappointed.
Clay thought, however, that he could control the
Administration, and undertook with the assistance
of the Cabinet to bring all into a harmonious support
of his &ldquo;system.&rdquo; The law creating the Independent
Treasury, for which Jackson and Van Buren
had labored industriously for six years before its
final passage, was promptly repealed. In place of the
Independent Treasury there was to be a National
Bank, but the President was reported to be hostile
to such a bank unless it should be located in the
District of Columbia, and the consent of the States
should be made necessary before branches could be
established anywhere. Aware of Tyler's scruples on
this and other measures, Clay marshaled his followers
in both houses, held his friends in the Cabinet
in his firm grasp, and was reported to have declared:
&ldquo;Tyler dares not resist me; I will drive him before
me.&rdquo; Tyler was not the man to be driven, and meanwhile
Calhoun, Benton, and their friends were rally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ing
around him in the hope of breaking down once
again the program of Clay.</p>

<p>A bank law was passed. On the 16th of August
it was vetoed, and there ensued another party break
very much like that which Calhoun led in 1831.
Many Southern Whigs supported the President;
Eastern Whigs burned Tyler in effigy as &ldquo;the
traitor.&rdquo; A second bank bill was passed only to meet
another veto; and the Clay scheme for the distribution
of the proceeds of the land sales, on which he
had set his heart, was so mutilated by amendments
that it could not serve the purpose of its friends.
Anger and denunciation were the order of the day in
Washington. Clay called a conference of the members
of Tyler's Cabinet early in September, and advised
all to resign at once in order to isolate their
chief. The advice was followed by all save Webster,
who retained his post and otherwise refused to
accept the dictation of the Kentucky leader. Calhoun,
Henry A. Wise, William C. Rives, and other
leaders of Congress applauded the President and
Webster. Congress adjourned on September 13 in
the worst possible humor. Excitement now ran high
throughout the country. Whig meetings were held
everywhere, some to denounce, some to defend the Virginian
President. The congressional elections came
on and the voters divided sharply. But the Democrats
won, which meant that the next Congress would
be deadlocked&mdash;the Senate Whig, and the House
Democratic. Under these circumstances Tyler gathered
about him a Cabinet to his own liking and
planned a forward step in the national policy. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the regular session of Congress a protective tariff
law which restored many of the high duties of 1832
was enacted. Tyler gave his assent, perhaps in the
hope of holding his New England friends like Webster.
In view of the fact that the next Congress
would be at least half anti-tariff, this move on the
part of the Whigs was resented in the South, where
leaders like Robert Barnwell Rhett still spoke openly
of secession in case the old protectionist policy
should be resumed.</p>

<p>The lines were being drawn for the next presidential
race. Clay came back to Congress in December,
1841, deeply resentful toward the President
and displeased at Webster. Having carried through
Congress the tariff bill already mentioned, he rose
on March 31 to offer &ldquo;the last motion I shall
ever make in this body,&rdquo; and to read his farewell
address after the manner of his great antagonist
Jackson, who had sent to Congress a similar message
on his retirement in March, 1837. It was an
affecting scene as the able and dramatic orator
prayed &ldquo;the most precious blessings upon the Senate,&rdquo;

even upon Calhoun, who at the close extended
his hand for the first time in several years. &ldquo;Sober
old Senators as well as ladies in the galleries shed
tears at the scene&rdquo;; yet it was known that Clay
would seek the Presidency two years later. Calhoun,
likewise, retired &ldquo;forever&rdquo; from the august legislative
assembly, twelve months later, the better to lay
his plans for the Democratic nomination in 1844.
Though the South was not ready to unite in support
of its greatest statesman, its leaders were ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
adopt his views and carry out his policy. The South,
with its cotton, tobacco, and sugar plantations yielding
their increasing annual returns, was preparing
for another effort at getting control of the National
Government. And changes of sentiment as well as
economic development favored her in the struggle.</p>

<p>In Virginia the reforms of 1829 had been inadequate.
The slavery problem was still a burning question,
and the Nat Turner insurrection of 1831, in
which a few slaves rose against their masters and
killed many men, women, and children, forced a
reconsideration. Again the difficult problem was declared
insoluble. Thomas R. Dew, a professor of political
science in William and Mary College, gave
the deciding counsel in elaborate testimony before
a committee of the legislature, which was
enlarged and published in book form in May, 1832.
He contended that slavery was a positive good; that
negroes could not live in the South except in a state
of bondage; and that for the State of Virginia, at
least, it was a most profitable institution. The time
had passed, he contended, for men to believe or teach
the fallacies of the Declaration of Independence.
Society, certainly Southern society, was taking on a
stratified form in which all men had their definite
places; and the North, too, was fast drifting in the
same direction, because of the influence of their growing
industries, in which it was essential that some
should be masters of great plants and direct the
labor of thousands of people. Few books ever influenced
Southern life so much as did this little word
of clear reasoning and convincing statistics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>A year later Calhoun was offering the same arguments
in the United States Senate; South Carolina
had already come in a practical way to the same
conclusion. North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
and Louisiana accepted the teaching that
slavery was a beneficent social arrangement. In
Kentucky and Tennessee, where James G. Birney
and John Rankin had long worked for gradual
emancipation, sentiment rapidly crystallized about
the same dogma. Southern anti-slavery leaders emigrated
to Ohio during the next few years, &ldquo;leaving
Ephraim joined to his idols&rdquo;; and Southern men in
Congress now replied with increasing earnestness to
the petitions which came from Northern abolitionists.
In 1837 it was decided not to receive such petitions,
and John Quincy Adams was given his great theme
for agitation; the United States mails were also
closed to abolitionist literature intended for Southern
distribution. The representatives of the great
region which stretched from Baltimore to New Orleans
and extended from the coast to the mountains,
united almost to a man in defense of &ldquo;the institutions
of the South,&rdquo; and he who offered argument or
example to the contrary was then unwelcome and
later compelled to hold his tongue or emigrate.</p>

<p>Calhoun now became the undisputed leader of the
plantation interests of the South, and few men were
better fitted for the great commission. A keen and
able debater and an enthusiastic Southerner, a combination
in himself of the up-country ideals and the
low-country purposes, he had become the idol of
South Carolina. Conciliatory in manner and pure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in all his public and private life, he won the respect
and friendship of the best men in the North, like the
Lowells and Winthrops of Massachusetts, and of
Senators Allen, Hannegan, Breese, and the Dodges
of the Northwest. Devoted to the ideal of a great
American Union which he had made strong at the
close of the second war with England, he was willing
always to yield something to the West if only his
&ldquo;one institution&rdquo; be left alone. Badly treated by
Jackson and Van Buren, he had yet forgiven and
joined hands with them both in 1840, in the hope
that the power of Clay and his Eastern allies might
be broken. In Congress and out he was the leader
of the South as that section began to gird her loins
for the fight over tariff, slavery, and expansion in
1840-44.</p>

<p>While the South was coming to one opinion on
the great question of slavery, the West had been
reviving her old ambitions and claims for more
lands. So long as there was plenty of free lands
and wide wildernesses, the Westerner felt that the
American Republic was a free country; but when
these began to fail he imagined himself hemmed in
and stifled. In 1812 he had demanded Canada and
Florida. He secured only the latter in 1819, and that
after giving up Texas. The ink was hardly dry on
the parchment of the treaty of that year before
leading Westerners began their campaign for the
&ldquo;reannexation&rdquo; of Texas. Stephen Austin, who
settled in Texas, and Sam Houston, who deserted
his wife for a home on the distant Southwestern
frontier, kept the question alive. Thousands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Southerners and Westerners poured into the new
cotton region between 1828 and 1836, and in the
latter year they fought with the Mexicans the battle
of San Jacinto, which gave Texas her freedom. A
new American Republic with a pro-slavery constitution
was speedily organized. Though Van Buren
evaded the issue, Calhoun and the South urged
immediate annexation.</p>

<p>There was thus a Southern call to the isolated
President in 1842 to take up the Texas problem.
Moreover, Virginia under the apportionment of
1841 lost five Representatives in the National House;
South Carolina's number fell from nine to seven.
North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Georgia
barely held their own. The older South was distinctly
losing in the national race, despite the three-fifths
rule on slavery. The Southwest gained some
members, but the Northwest was growing faster. It
was time for the South to act if she was to maintain
her position in the country. In making up his
Cabinet in the autumn of 1841, and again in filling
the vacancies that occurred from time to time, the
President selected men who favored expansion in
the Southwest. The leaders of the Administration
in the House of Representatives were ex-Governor
Gilmer and Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, and the
spokesmen of the South generally joined these in
demanding the immediate annexation of Texas as a
Southern measure. Calhoun, though not speaking so
often, was the real leader of this cause in the Senate,
and he constantly urged upon his friends the necessity
of this acquisition as a distinct aid to his section.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all the West favored this Southern proposition;
but an equally important matter to them
was the occupation of Oregon. In Ohio, Michigan,
and northern Illinois there was some indifference as
to Texas, but none on the subject of Oregon. The
vast region stretching from the forty-second parallel
of north latitude to Alaska, and embracing an empire
in itself, was held jointly with England, whose
fur traders had actually occupied the country on
the northern side of the Columbia River. England
desired to hold the promising region. Under the
agreement of 1818, renewed in 1828, either country
was to give one year's notice of a purpose to
abandon joint control, and, should the relation with
England be dissolved, the stronger party would
doubtless obtain the better part of the territory.
The people of the Northwest under radical leadership
soon learned to demand all Oregon; English
fur interests understood the situation well, and they
pressed their Government to seize all the territory
along the Pacific to the Bay of California. And
English relations with Mexico were such that Lower
California was apt to be added to Oregon in case of
a break with the United States.</p>

<p>In the East there had been reason for increasing
irritation between the two Governments. British
public opinion had been distinctly unfriendly since
the Canadian insurrection of 1837-38, when so
many Americans gave assistance to the insurgents.
And this unfriendliness was fed by the ill-concealed
desire of the people of the West for the annexation
of Canada to the United States. When the Amer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ican
ship Caroline, which had been assisting the
Canadian insurrectionists, was seized and destroyed
by the English on Lake Erie, an American citizen
was killed. This was amicably arranged; but in
1840 a certain Alexander McLeod, then in New
York, avowed that he had killed the American and
was promptly seized by the state authorities and
put on trial for his life. McLeod now claimed that
he had done the deed in obedience to orders, and
the British Minister came to his assistance. Officers
of the American State Department took the
same view, but they were helpless, and for a time
it seemed that one of the States would put to
death as a murderer a man whom both England
and the United States recognized to be innocent.
War seemed imminent, but as so often happens
in Anglo-Saxon procedure, a way out of the legal
<i>impasse</i> was found in a fictitious <i>alibi</i>, and McLeod
was acquitted.</p>

<p>When Sir Robert Peel became the head of the
English Government in 1841 he sent, as Minister to
Washington, Lord Ashburton, one of the Baring
Brothers who had had such large business relations
with many of the States and with the old National
Bank. Ashburton and Webster were personal friends,
and they were likely to find a solution to other important
and pressing problems engaging the attention of
both countries. One of these disputes had to do with
the suppression of the nefarious African slave trade,
which still flourished in spite of the most stringent of
laws, national and international. The difficulty lay
in the enforcement of law. The South did not re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>gard
slavery as an unmixed evil, and hence Southern
Presidents had not been overzealous of invoking the
severe law against the slave trade. England stood
ready to enforce her laws, but then the traders
would raise the American flag. This necessitated
the exercise of the obsolete right of search of suspected
vessels, if anything was to be done. But the
people of the United States resented the exercise of
the right, and Northern statesmen were also loath
to allow this. To obviate all difficulty the two
Governments agreed in 1842 to maintain a joint
naval patrol of the African coast. The South was
not quite pleased, and a great many people of the
West were displeased that Webster had yielded the
right of search in disguise, as it was thought.</p>

<p>At the same time a matter of larger importance to
the North, the settlement of the long-disputed boundary
between Maine and Nova Scotia, was pending.
Since 1838 there had been quarrels and actual encounters
along the northeastern boundary, which
had won the name of &ldquo;the Aroostook War.&rdquo; Both
Maine and the National Congress had appropriated
money to maintain American rights on the border,
and here again there was reason to fear war. Webster
and Ashburton took up the problem and by mutual
concessions came to a fair but very unpopular
agreement. They also settled outstanding disputes
concerning the long boundary between the Great
Lakes and the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>But the question of dividing Oregon was left untouched
even by these friendly diplomats. Nor could
they do more than discuss the critical Creole trouble,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
which just now came to complicate the relations of
both peoples, evidently desirous of avoiding war.
The Creole was a vessel engaged in the domestic
slave trade. In 1841 this ship, bound for New Orleans,
was seized by the slaves on board, who killed
its crew and carried it into the port of Nassau. The
local courts punished some of the negroes as murderers
and set the others free. Speaking for the American
Government, Webster demanded of England an
apology and compensation for the slaves. Ashburton
defended his country stoutly and refused satisfaction.
Again public opinion, at least Southern opinion,
was greatly excited, but nothing was done about
the Creole case until 1853, when it was submitted
to arbitration, and compensation was allowed the
owners of the slaves.</p>

<p>Thus the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 was
a settlement of some threatening difficulties and a
tacit compromise or ignoring of others. It served
the useful purpose of keeping the peace between
kindred peoples. The Oregon and Texas questions
were left open, and these were assuming more
dangerous forms with the passage of time.</p>

<p>This served to direct attention to the Pacific Coast
and even the Far East, where New England merchants
and shipowners had long driven a profitable
trade. President Tyler sent Commodore Jones to
the Pacific to protect American interests; he proposed
to send a commissioner to China in the hope
of aiding American commerce there, and he began
to consult members of Congress about the possibility
of obtaining Texas, California, and Oregon all in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
treaties with Mexico and England. He offered to
send Webster to London to conduct the negotiations,
and at his instance John Quincy Adams wrote
Edward Everett, the American Minister to England,
that he might resign and go to China to do pioneer
work for New England interests. The Webster-Ashburton
Treaty was to be followed by a greater
one, securing to the United States the coveted expansion
southwest, west, and northwest. Thus Calhoun
and his extreme Southerners, Benton and his
ardent imperialist followers, and the radical Northwest
were all to be satisfied at a single stroke of
state, and Webster, the New Englander, was to be
the happy instrument and perhaps become President
in consequence.</p>

<p>Everett refused to resign, and Webster had promised
his Whig friends to leave the State Department.
Tyler did not despair; when the great New Englander
retired in 1842, like Clay, to private life, he
invited Hugh S. Legar&eacute;, of Charleston, to the vacant
place. A year later Abel P. Upshur succeeded
to the office. All the while the President was seeking
to guide the Administration into other channels
than the old ones of tariff, bank, and internal improvements.</p>

<p>The Texan envoys to Washington repeatedly
urged unofficially the annexation of their country,
which had fallen into a state of semi-bankruptcy,
and whose governor, Sam Houston, was making
overtures for English protection as an alternative to
failure to get a favorable hearing in Washington.
Southern States petitioned for annexation, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

Middle Westerners met in a convention at Cincinnati
in August, 1843, and demanded the immediate
seizure of Texas and prompt occupation of Oregon.
Thousands of emigrants left Missouri during the
summer of 1843 for the Columbia Valley, under the
encouragement of Senator Benton and for the purpose
of holding the country against English fur traders
or more permanent settlers. Under all this pressure
the Administration let it be known in Congress
that at least Texas would be annexed. Upshur reopened
negotiations with the Texan envoy in Washington.
Immediately John Quincy Adams protested,
declaring the &ldquo;Confederacy&rdquo; to be dissolved in
case Tyler's &ldquo;nefarious&rdquo; scheme should be consummated;
but the President continued to press
the Texan negotiations.</p>

<p>When the treaty with the new republic was about
concluded, Upshur was accidentally killed by the
explosion of a gun on the ship Princeton. Calhoun,
whose ardent candidacy for the Democratic nomination
had failed, was called to the State Department
to take up the unfinished work. Meanwhile the
campaigns of the two great parties were already far
advanced. Clay was the acknowledged candidate of
the Whigs, and Van Buren had obtained the pledged
support of two thirds of the delegations to the next
Democratic Convention, which was to meet in Baltimore
in May, 1844. Instinctively dreading new
issues, Van Buren arranged a visit to Jackson in
the early spring, and on his return he called on
Clay at Lexington, Kentucky, where it seems to
have been agreed that the two candidates should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
eventually eliminate the Texas proposition from the
platforms of the two great parties. On April 20,
when Clay was in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Van
Buren was at his home at Lindenwald, New York,
public letters were given out by both leaders. Both
advised against discussing the one thing everybody
was discussing. The simultaneous appearance of these
formal statements, each advising the same thing,
caused a national sensation. Men thought that the
two candidates had agreed beforehand what the people
should not do. In Virginia, South Carolina, and
Mississippi, where Texas feeling ran high, Democratic
opinion could not be restrained, and meetings
were called to reconsider the instructions of their
delegations to the Baltimore Convention; nor were
the Southern Whigs less anxious about the outcome,
though the party as a whole acquiesced in Clay's
wish that Texas should be eliminated from their
forthcoming platform.</p>

<p>At this point Robert J. Walker, Senator from
Mississippi, a shrewd little man who had gone to
the Southwest eighteen years before to make his fortune,
assumed the management of the Democratic
party. A bold land speculator and an able lawyer,
connected with the powerful Dallas and Bache families
in Pennsylvania, he quickly rose to a commanding
position in his State and was sent to the United
States Senate, where he soon made himself felt as
the most radical representative of Southern and
Western interests, urging the rapid removal of the
Indians beyond the western frontiers, free homesteads
for all who would go West, and the immedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ate
annexation of Texas. An intimate friend of
Van Buren, a persistent opponent of Calhoun, and
a rival of Benton for national honors, Walker published
on Jackson Day, January 8, 1844, a letter to
the public which was immediately reprinted in the
newspapers of the South and West, and which in
pamphlet form had a very wide circulation. In this
letter he came out boldly for the "reannexation of
Texas and the reoccupation of Oregon,"&mdash;all Oregon.
His rhetorical language and his defiance of
England gained the public ear on both Texas and
Oregon, while his shrewd suggestions of commercial
expansion in the Pacific won powerful support in
New York and Boston. But the greatest stroke of
this publication was the apparent Southern demand
for all Oregon, and before the Van Buren-Clay

&ldquo;self-denying ordinances&rdquo; appeared, Walker was
forging the union of South and West on the proposition,
reannexation of Texas and reoccupation of
Oregon, and maneuvering in Washington for what
was later called the &ldquo;bargain of the Baltimore Convention.&rdquo;
Walker's relations with the Pennsylvania
leaders gave him a strong position in that great
Democratic community, and he soon secured the support
of Thomas Ritchie, the master politician in Virginia.
When the Democrats met, late in May, the
&ldquo;little Senator&rdquo; was in perfect control. He renewed
and vitalized the rule of the Democratic party
whereby the candidate must secure two thirds of all
votes cast in order to receive the nomination. He
procured the passage of this resolution by a mere
majority vote, and thus Van Buren, who had a ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>jority
of the delegates instructed to vote for him,
was deprived of the leadership of the party. The
Walker slogan, &ldquo;All of Texas, all of Oregon,&rdquo; was
adopted by the convention, and James K. Polk, formerly
Speaker of the House of Representatives, was
nominated for the Presidency. Walker's brother-in-law,
George M. Dallas, a Pennsylvania protectionist,
was nominated for the Vice-Presidency. It was but a
few days before the Northwestern men indicated the
trend of events by giving every assurance of their
support and adding to the campaign cry of Walker
the &ldquo;fifty-four-forty-or-fight&rdquo; slogan which was
heard on every stump from June till November.</p>

<p>Van Buren was humiliated and eliminated from
the counsels of the party; Clay laughed at his
&ldquo;dark-horse&rdquo; competitor, of whom he affected never
to have heard; Calhoun, the legitimate beneficiary
of the Texas propaganda, joined Walker with heart
and soul and aided greatly in the management of the
campaign. A new Democratic r&eacute;gime&mdash;the South
and West co&ouml;perating&mdash;had been founded. This
second coalition aimed at Clay and the East resembled
very strikingly that of 1828. And new issues
had been injected into the national discussion. A
rapid extension of the national domain to the Rio
Grande, to the Pacific, and to 54&deg; 40' of north latitude
in the Far Northwest was opposed to Clay's
well-worn program of a protective tariff, national
bank, and internal improvements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Calhoun and Tyler completed their
treaty with Texas and submitted it to the Senate,
where it was held in suspense until after the meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ing
of the conventions. Tyler, after some hesitation,
gave his support to Polk and Dallas. Calhoun suppressed
uprisings against the new leadership in South
Carolina, where strong doubt prevailed as to the
purposes of Walker and Dallas with reference to the
tariff. The old statesman, isolated though he was,
thought that if the South and West could be held
together the future would be secure. He took pleasure
in the belief that &ldquo;this is the end of Clay,&rdquo; who
had so long troubled the national waters, while the
politicians of the new coalition assured him that he
would succeed Polk in 1848. Webster said little
during the campaign; New England was divided by
the promises of a great commercial expansion and
the annexation of Oregon. The election of Polk and
Dallas justified the bold moves of the Baltimore Convention.
The scheme of Tyler, looking to the annexation
of Texas, California, and Oregon, was now to be
put into effect, even at the risk of war with England,
whence serious warnings had been coming
since the new national purpose became clear.</p>

<p>After years of uncertainty and deadlock, the country
was now prepared for a forward movement, and
though Polk was not her ideal statesman, the people
rallied with fair unanimity to his standard. The
new Administration would represent the new Democratic
party&mdash;a resolute South and an ardent West.
And the President-elect, simple and direct in all his
ways, was determined to carry out the purposes of his
supporters, namely, set the country upon a career of
expansion hitherto unparalleled in its history.</p>

<p>In Illinois, Missouri, and throughout the South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the demand was well-nigh unanimous that the disputed
region along the Rio Grande should be held as against
Mexico, and that California and Oregon should
be seized and colonized. Cass, the older, and Douglas,
the younger leader of the Northwest, were agreed
in these extreme demands; even Benton, the disappointed
friend of Van Buren, found compensation in
the proposed Pacific frontier, while a powerful group
of Southerners led by Governor Gilmer, of Virginia,
Robert Barnwell Rhett, of South Carolina, William
L. Yancey, of Alabama, and Jefferson Davis,
of Mississippi, took up the program of Calhoun and
pressed it almost daily upon Congress and the country.
The South was about to resume control of the
national fortunes.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

<p>In that region, where cotton was king, and tobacco,
sugar, and rice were powerful allies, a unique
civilization had grown up. The plantation was the
model, and the patriarchal master of slaves the ideal
character which the ambitious poor imitated everywhere.
The elegant life of the colonial plantation
houses, which adorned the banks of the winding rivers
of the old South in the days of the Revolution,
had gradually moved westward and southwestward
until the larger tobacco area of the Piedmont region
extended from Petersburg, Virginia, to Greensboro,
North Carolina, and from the falls of the rivers to
the slopes of the Blue Ridge. Instead of running
away from their slaves, as John Randolph had feared
Southern gentlemen would be compelled to do, the
tobacco planters found their business increasingly
prosperous as the great cotton area south of them
opened larger markets for their crops and higher
prices for their surplus negroes. Even the wheat-growers
of Virginia and Maryland became again
prosperous when the great canals and the improved
turnpikes reached the valley of Virginia and opened
still wider areas of rich lands to the Richmond and
Baltimore markets. The plantation form of life penetrated
the high lands of Virginia almost to the Tennessee
border, and slavery was fastening its hold
upon the up-country people who had formerly been
hostile.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

<p>But the vast cotton region, embracing the better
part of middle and eastern North Carolina and the
accessible lands of the lower South to Eastern Texas,
and extending over most of the Mississippi Valley to
St. Louis, was the heart of the South, which supported
the Polk Administration and waged the war
upon Mexico soon to begin. In this fine country,
men of ability made fortunes in a few years and
learned to imitate the life of the old southern manor
houses. Forests were cleared away in winter by the
sturdy hands of slaves, and new fields were opened
to cotton culture each spring to supply the places of
those that had been rapidly worn down by unscientific
methods of agriculture. The cabins which made
the homes of well-to-do men in the Jeffersonian epoch
gave way to substantial frame houses with massive
columns and wide verandas, with great hallways and
broad banquet-rooms, which so much delighted the
heart of the planter of Calhoun's day. In a warm
climate like that of the cotton region the object of
the builder was always to attain cool recesses and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>

retired gardens, where the social life of the time displayed
itself.</p>

<p>The houses were built on hilltops covered with
primeval oaks, which cast a dense shade over all.
Sometimes stone or brick walls protected the premises
against the outer world, and wide entrances,
guarded on either side by sculptured lions or tigers,
gave a dignity and a splendor which reminded one
of the estates of English noblemen. In the rear of
these pretentious and sometimes beautiful houses
were the rows of negro cabins, with their little gardens
for the raising of vegetables and the ranges for
chickens, as dear to the palates of negro slaves as
to those of visiting clergymen. The barns and carriage
houses completed the outfit. Where hundreds
of bales of cotton and thousands of barrels of corn
were grown annually, there would be driving or saddle
horses for the master's family and many Kentucky
mules for the work of the fields; and a plantation
took on the appearance of a busy colony in a
new country. Sixty to a hundred negroes were regarded
as the best labor unit for profitable agriculture.
Of these there would be a few house servants
trained in all the intricacies of patriarchal hospitality
and courtesy. The carriage driver and keeper of
the stables, sometimes clad in the extra dignity of a
special livery and a tall silk hat, a tyrant to all the
little negroes, but an obsequious flatterer to those
who were welcome at the master's house, was perhaps
the most envied man of the estate. To see this
matchless son of Africa mounted on the high seat of
an old-fashioned English carriage, as he drove his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
prancing horses to the front door of the &ldquo;great
house&rdquo; and asked if all were ready for church,
was to get a glimpse of the old South itself. The
boasted freedom of &ldquo;poor white trash&rdquo; or of &ldquo;impudent
free issue negroes&rdquo; had no attractions to him
who enjoyed these high prerogatives.</p>

<p>The master who was responsible for the multitudinous
life of the plantation, arbiter of the fortunes,
sometimes, of a thousand men, was usually conscious
of his power and, when &ldquo;times were good,&rdquo; kind to
his dependents. He liked to see his negroes fat and
happy, for a &ldquo;likely slave&rdquo; was as good as money in
the bank. Accustomed to the exercise of authority,
he was apt to be a member of the county court, the
actual governing agency of the old South, and as such
he was always &ldquo;squire.&rdquo; From the county court he
went to the state legislature, where he and his fellow
planters made the laws of these sovereign States of
the old r&eacute;gime. From local magistrate to chief executive
the Southern community was governed by the
owners of slaves, and the great men whom they chose
to speak for the South in Congress or to advise the
President and his Cabinet or to sit upon the benches
of the federal courts were invariably masters of plantations,
trained from early youth to the exercise of
authority and accustomed to receive the homage of
their neighbors. It was a mighty social and economic
organization which had grown up in and spread over
the richer lands of South and West, as far as the borders
of Mexico and the valleys of the Ohio and Missouri.
The wheat and tobacco growers, the rice and
sugar planters were allied to the more powerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
cotton lords, and, though there were party differences,
all spoke the same voice in the national life.
Of the five or six millions of southern white people
in 1845 only seven or eight thousand were great
plantation masters, though some three hundred
thousand were either owners of slaves or members
of the privileged families&mdash;a larger proportion
than usual for a favored class, but still a small
number when compared to the total population of
the country which was, from 1845 to 1860, controlled
by them.</p>

<p>As was natural, the professional classes of the
South, the lawyers, clergymen, physicians, and teachers,
were in close alliance with the planters, their
callings and their incomes being directly dependent
on them. A successful professional man soon became
a master and usually retired to a country seat. If a
poor but capable young man gave promise of power
and leadership he was soon accepted by his dominant
neighbors and became a son-in-law of a privileged
family; if a preacher rose to fame doubting or even
condemning the institutions of the South, he was apt
to find a way to change his views and to become
a part of the system before he reached his mature
years. The articulate South was, therefore, in economic
and social life a unit in 1845, and this unit
was the strongest group in the country as a whole.
Its demand for expansion towards the southwest
was based upon the common desire, the common law
of growth, and this growth was the only means of
winning new votes in Congress and in the electoral
college. It was the same motive which actuated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
farmers of the Northwest and the commercial leaders
of New England when they demanded of the Federal
Government the seizure of Oregon or the protection
of ships upon the ocean.</p>

<p>If the planter and dominant element of the South
urged Polk and Walker onward in their course and
gave power to Calhoun, the greater masses of non-slaveholding
Southerners were hardly less enthusiastic.
The earlier jealousy and fear of the planters
had everywhere weakened as the new lands of the
South and West gave opportunity to the more ambitious
to rise in the social and economic scale. The
sons of small farmers and landless men in the old
South had built the cotton kingdom of the lower
South, and were now drawing aristocratic Virginia
and the Carolinas into a close union with the new
region. The widening of the area of slavery was
equivalent to the opening of a social safety valve to
the older and stratifying life of the South. Young
men who had been hostile to slavery at home became
friendly allies in a new environment. Thus the small
farmers became enthusiastic supporters of the great
machine of which slavery was the base.</p>

<p>Not only so, the growers of corn and wheat in the
remote hills and mountains of the South, the men
who distilled their grain into strong drink, those
who raised pigs or cotton a hundred or two hundred
miles west of the tobacco and cotton belts,
could always find a market in the plantation towns
where calicos, &ldquo;store-clothes,&rdquo; and trinkets could be
had for themselves and families. The long trains of
quaint, covered tobacco wagons which wound their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
way over rough roads from the mountains to the
black belt carried whiskey or other up-country products
to the plantations; the droves of mules, cattle,
or hogs which poured into the Carolinas and the
Gulf region from East Tennessee and Kentucky
were bonds of attraction between the planters and the
non-slaveholding elements too powerful to be ignored.
And as time passed the legislatures under planter
control built better highways and projected railways
into the richer sections of the interior, which invariably
made allies of these new economic communities,
and gradually slavery followed in the wake of the
new channels of communication.</p>

<p>The most helpless of the Southern groups were the
poorer farmers, who lived on the semi-sterile lands
which the planters refused to occupy or in the pine
barrens of the eastern Carolinas, and the landless
class which hung on to the skirts of slavery. Unambitious,
ignorant, and improvident, frequently the
&ldquo;ne'er-do-wells&rdquo; of the old families, ignored by the
wealthy and spurned by the slaves, who gave them
the name of &ldquo;poor white trash,&rdquo; their lot was hard,
indeed. They earned a few dollars a year at odd jobs,
raised a few hogs or at most a bale or two of cotton,
and lived in cabins little better than those occupied
by the negroes. Their children were numerous,
without educational advantages, and accustomed to
the poor and meager cultural life of an outcast class.
Their outlook was no better than that of their parents.
Barefoot, half-clad, yet alert and agile, hating
negroes and fearing the masters, these &ldquo;Anglo-Saxons&rdquo;

offered the problem of the South. Unac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>customed
to independent voting, they did not endanger
the existing order, and even when they were
aroused to a sense of their position, their ignorance
and dependence and prejudices prevented them from
organizing in self-defense. They usually followed
their economic superiors, and learned to denounce
the tariff, internal improvements, and &ldquo;scheming
Yankees&rdquo; as roundly as did their wealthy neighbors.</p>

<p>Still, life in the South was in the open; the joys
and the sports of the people were those of healthy
rural communities. The well-to-do and even the
poorer classes lived on horseback, bet on the races,
and participated in the rough-and-tumble games of
the court days. The wealthy did not refuse all relations
with &ldquo;the people&rdquo; on such occasions. The
planter knew and called familiarly by name every
man in his part of the county, and the magistrates
who made up the courts of the people exercised a
kindly patriarchal authority over their &ldquo;inferiors,&rdquo;
the dependent whites. There were few occupants of
jails or penitentiaries; poorhouses were often tenantless,
and asylums for the insane were not numerous
or crowded. Beggars and tramps were unknown.
Judged by the facts of life the system of slavery and
large proprietors was not so bad as it appeared; and
as the South came into full self-consciousness, say
with the inauguration of Polk and Dallas, the problems
of adjustment of the different economic groups,
of providing better educational facilities for the
poorer classes, and of meeting certain religious and
social requirements of the slaves themselves, were
fully recognized by the masters, and beginnings of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

improvement in all these matters were already
making.</p>

<p>In nothing was this more evident than in Southern
religious life. The South which followed Jefferson
was largely indifferent to religious dogmas of all
kinds. Most of the greater leaders had been deists
rather than Christians; nor had they suffered for
these opinions at the hands of the people. Calhoun's
Unitarianism had in no way retarded his political
career. But before 1830 a change was taking place.
The stout Presbyterianism of the up-country forced
the retirement of one of the professors of the University
of Virginia, in its earlier years, and it compelled
the resignation of President Cooper of the
University of South Carolina, in 1836, because of
his denial of the inspiration of the Pentateuch. The
Presbyterians had grown powerful and wealthy; they
asserted their influence in Virginia and South Carolina,
and they were already recognized as leaders
in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky. What
this denomination did was applauded by the more
numerous Baptists and Methodists, whose membership
was as yet too poor to command the influence
of their rivals.</p>

<p>Before 1844, however, these great religious organizations
in the South, with a combined membership
of nearly a million, received full recognition. With
a small-farmer and landless membership they had
opposed slavery and the whole aristocratic system before
1820, but as the years passed, tobacco and cotton
culture made many of them wealthy and opened
the way to all who were ambitious to rise. At once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the official attitude began to change. The preachers
ceased first to denounce &ldquo;the institution,&rdquo; and finally
without offense became slave-owners themselves. The
clergy's stern rebukes of fashion, of dancing, and of
&ldquo;the wearing of fine raiment&rdquo; ceased or lost its
effect. Presbyterians had long believed in an educated
ministry, and when they forced their influence
into political life, they were already friendly to the
dominant ideas of the South. Now the Baptists and
Methodists built colleges for the training of young
ministers, and preaching in their simple churches
was made to conform to the canons of good taste.
Throughout the South the churches became the allies
of the existing economic and social order, and they
presented a solid front to those who proposed to discipline
men for holding other men in bondage. Their
clergy formulated a strong Biblical and patriarchal
defense of the South. Slavery, from being an institution
to be lamented as an evil, became a blessing
sustained by the Holy Scriptures, according to the
ablest ministers of God.</p>

<p>When the Northern branches of these churches
found how completely their Southern brethren had
yielded to the powerful social pressure of their local
life, a vigorous attempt was made to correct the tendency.
It failed, and in 1844-45 the Baptists of the
East and those of the upper Northwest refused to
co&ouml;perate with Southern churches which insisted on
the right to send out missionaries who owned slaves.
A Southern Baptist Church was the immediate result.
In the same year, 1844, the Methodists of the
East and upper West refused to recognize the min<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>istrations
of a bishop who owned slaves, and a break-up
of the church followed. The Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, was organized at Louisville the following
year. The Presbyterians and Episcopalians
had become so completely reconciled to the aristocratic
life which slavery connoted that they sustained
no serious breach in their ranks. In the North as well
as in the South they accepted slavery. A notable result
of these breaks in the Baptist and Methodist
churches was the rapid increase of membership of
both in the South. Within a period of ten years the
Southern Baptists were as powerful as the American
Baptists had been in 1844. The same is true of the
Methodists, and what happened in the South was
paralleled in the North. Pro-slavery churches in the
South and anti-slavery churches in the North seemed
to be required by the people. Revivals, educational
improvements, and missionary zeal were the fruits
of the &ldquo;reformation.&rdquo; Politicians like Calhoun, who
watched and counseled these peaceful schisms, urged
that the Union must in due time likewise break into
pieces; but the great economic forces of the country
were as yet too strong; common markets, interlocking
transportation systems, and the extraordinary
prosperity which followed the Polk r&eacute;gime defeated
the wishes of those who thought that two confederations
within the area of the United States would be
better than one.</p>

<p>Thus, when Polk took up the forward program
which had been outlined at Baltimore, and which was
to antiquate the &ldquo;American System&rdquo; over which
Clay and Jackson and their respective groups had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

fought so bitterly since 1824, the South was rapidly
crystallizing into a solid section with definite ideas
and purposes. The plantation owners were in full
command; the older and small-farmer element was
falling into line behind their pro-slavery leaders; the
social and religious life had become orthodox and
stratified; and the clergy, who now preached acceptably
to great masses of people, were, like those of New
England, in full sympathy with the dominant economic
interests of their time. The immediate future
of the South was fairly certain, and Southern leaders
assumed a militant tone indicative of the wishes of
their people.</p>

<h4>WAR AND CONQUEST</h4>

<p>The treaty which Upshur and Calhoun negotiated
with the Texan envoys in the spring of 1844 was
presented to the Senate in April, and held in committee
until after the two party conventions had met
in Baltimore. The Whigs condemned it, as has been
noted, and the Democrats accepted it. It was a mere
matter of form, then, for the Whig Senate to reject
the treaty which had become in a great measure the
platform of their opponents. When Congress reassembled
in December the result of the election had
made it plain that Calhoun and Walker, and not
Clay and Van Buren, represented the wishes of the
people, though the majority of the popular vote was
exceedingly small.</p>

<p>Tyler seemed anxious to hasten the work of annexation,
and he recommended the accomplishment of
his purpose by joint resolution of the two houses
of Congress. Benton, who disliked Tyler and hated
Calhoun, and who had opposed the adoption of the
treaty in the preceding spring, now gave his influence
to the Administration, and during the closing hours
of the session the House and the Senate passed the
joint resolution making Texas a State by narrow
majorities. There was widespread opposition to the
annexation of new territory, especially pro-Southern
territory, by the new method. Joint resolutions in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>

State legislatures that were evenly divided were not
unknown; but for Congress to evade a plain rule of
the Constitution requiring two thirds of the Senate
by a mere majority of both houses was denounced as
the rankest usurpation. Without serious concern
as to public opinion in the East or great deference to
the President-elect, Tyler and Calhoun hastened messengers
to Texas and ordered two regiments of troops,
under the command of Colonel Zachary Taylor, to
take position at Corpus Christi on the southern bank
of the Nueces River, and sent a squadron of the
navy, under Commodore Conner, to the mouth of
the Rio Grande. This disposition of the military and
naval forces of the United States was made to protect
Texas against a possible invasion by Mexico;
but it was sharp notice that the disputed region between
the Nueces and the Rio Grande would be held
for Texas. Tyler retired to his Virginia plantation,
leaving to Polk the more difficult task of securing
all Oregon.</p>

<p>Polk had already shown his self-reliance in refusing
to appoint Calhoun Secretary of State. That
eminent statesman was thoroughly familiar with the
foreign relations of the Government, and he enjoyed
a prestige that would have distinguished any administration;
besides, he was certain that he could bring
matters to a peaceful conclusion with both Mexico
and England. Nor had he failed in his loyalty to the
new President during the recent campaign. Still
Polk gave James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, the first
place in the Cabinet. Robert J. Walker asked and
received the second place&mdash;the Treasury. William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
L. Marcy, of New York, and John Y. Mason, of
Virginia, represented in the Cabinet those large Democratic
constituencies, while George Bancroft, the
historian, spoke for New England, though the people
of that section would never have named him for the
honor.</p>

<p>To the surprise of old political heads Polk announced
blandly in his inaugural that he would proceed
to &ldquo;reoccupy Oregon&rdquo;; that is, he would execute
the mandate of the Baltimore Convention even
at the cost of war with England! But Calhoun had
practically agreed with the British Minister to compromise
the conflicting claims to Oregon. Buchanan,
being a man of yielding temper, was disposed to the
same easy solution of the most dangerous problem
of the Administration. The President, however, restrained
his Secretary, and in the annual message of
December, 1845, he asked Congress to give him
authority to dissolve the copartnership of England
and the United States with reference to Oregon.
This was taken in both countries as inviting war.</p>

<p>Calhoun regarded this move as likely to be fatal
to the retention of Texas and certain to lose for the
country all of Oregon. He returned to the Senate
for the avowed purpose of preventing war. Webster,
in the Senate again, was on friendly terms with the
leaders of the English governing party, and both he
and they were striving to prevent the expansionists
from committing an overt act of hostility. Benton,
the foremost of expansionists before Tyler became
President, was also ready to compromise the dispute.
This meant that Calhoun, Webster, and Benton would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
unite their influence to defeat the foreign policy of
the President if it were not modified to suit their
views.</p>

<p>But the new leadership embraced a group of able
and bold men: John A. Dix, of New York; Caleb Cushing,
a Whig recruit from Massachusetts; James M.
Mason, of Virginia; Robert Barnwell Rhett, William
L. Yancey, and Jefferson Davis, of the lower South; and
David Atchison, Stephen A. Douglas, Lewis Cass, and
William Allen, of the Northwest,&mdash;all ardent expansionists
and &ldquo;big Americans&rdquo; who would not readily
suffer the defeat of the party program. During the
summer and autumn of 1845 their policy had been
worked out in detail and discussed among the men
who were to be responsible for its execution. In domestic
affairs their scheme embraced the settlement
of the long-disputed financial policy in a new Independent
or Sub-Treasury Bill which Secretary Walker
was preparing. The Tariff of 1842, which had
offended the Democratic South, was also to be reformed,
and Walker had written the new schedules
which Congress was to enact in due time. In order
to secure the necessary Western support for these
Southern purposes, the old internal improvements
program was revived in an enlarged rivers and harbors
bill. This was a big plan and the Democratic
majorities in House and Senate were very narrow.
The outlook was anything but encouraging, with
Webster, Calhoun, and Benton likely to be in opposition
on every point.</p>

<p>But Congress passed the Sub-Treasury Bill, by
which most of the financial measures of the preced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ing
administrations since 1833, resting on the mere
orders of President or Secretary of the Treasury,
were legalized. It was in the main the same law
which Van Buren had labored so long to secure,
but which the Whigs had repealed in 1841. The
money of the Government was henceforth to be kept
in certain designated sub-treasuries in leading cities
like New York, Baltimore, and New Orleans, and
drawn upon by the Secretaries of the Treasury when
needed. There was thus to be no national bank; and
the state banks were to continue issuing their paper,
which was to be the money of the people. Gold and
silver, coined by the government mint at Philadelphia,
were seldom demanded in ordinary business transactions,
though coin or bullion still remained the
redemption money of the banks and served as the
basis of exchange with foreign countries.</p>

<p>The South had preached free trade since 1828. Polk
and his Secretary of the Treasury had been prominent
exponents of the idea, despite some campaign bargaining
with Pennsylvania. In England Richard
Cobden, John Bright, and Sir Robert Peel were
about to secure the repeal of the age-old protective
system, and in both France and Germany the free-trade
agitation was daily winning recruits. Polk and
his advisers set themselves the task of securing the
passage of a &ldquo;free-trade tariff&rdquo; for the United States.
Walker submitted an able report in December, 1845.
A very high rate was recommended on all luxuries, including
wines and liquors; an average duty of twenty-five
per cent was to be laid on the great bulk of
imports which would compete with American cotton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
wool, and iron manufactures; and a long list of
articles of every day consumption on which no duties
should be imposed was submitted. Though the Pennsylvanians
denounced the proposed tariff bill as un-Democratic,
it became a law in July, 1846, proved
to be successful, and remained the corner-stone of
the Democratic structure till 1861.</p>

<p>The <i>douceur</i>, in the form of a bill for liberal internal
improvements for the Northwest, whose leaders
all voted for the tariff reductions, passed both houses
of Congress; but the members from the lower South,
led by Robert Barnwell Rhett, protested to the
last. Polk accepted their view and vetoed the bill.
Northwestern men cried out &ldquo;treachery&rdquo; so loudly
that summer, in a great mass meeting in Chicago,
that the President feared the party was seriously endangered.
Still, the three problems over which Clay,
Calhoun, and Webster had wrestled since 1816 had
been solved. The United States was henceforth to
manage its finances independently; the free-trade
element had won the ascendancy, and there was
not to be another high-tariff campaign until after the
Civil War; and internal improvements on a large
national scale were not to be undertaken until the
passage of the Pacific Railway Bill in 1862. The
only cloud above the political horizon was the anger
of the Northwestern Democrats.</p>

<p>There was more danger in carrying forward the
program which was intended to secure to the United
States Oregon, California, and New Mexico. But
the first step had already been taken. In April,
1846, both House and Senate, in spite of the oppo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>sition
of the older leaders, authorized the President to
give notice to England that joint occupation should
cease at the expiration of a year. The English people
were much excited, and the idea prevailed that this
was only a move on the part of the United States to
seize Canada, but the British Government renewed
the proposition to compromise on the forty-ninth
parallel, Vancouver Island to remain in British
possession. A treaty to this effect was accepted by
both Governments during the summer of 1846.
Polk could boast that the Oregon question had been
settled. Again the Northwestern Democrats, who had
been promised all of Oregon, were sorely disappointed.
One of their most popular leaders declared in the Senate:
&ldquo;James K. Polk has spoken words of falsehood,
and with the tongue of a serpent.&rdquo; Would the
Northwestern wing of the party continue loyal?
This may, perhaps, best be answered when we come
to discuss the Wilmot Proviso.</p>

<p>When the Oregon question was at its acutest
stage, in the autumn of 1845, Polk sent John Slidell,
an adroit politician of Louisiana, to Mexico, to
renew the friendly relations which had been broken
off immediately after the passage of the joint resolution
by Congress. Slidell was authorized to negotiate
a treaty by which European influence, then being
exerted in Mexico against the United States, was to
be counteracted, the annexation of Texas approved,
and all of the claims of American citizens against
Mexico were to be definitely satisfied. But as Mexico
had no funds in her treasury, Slidell was to assume
for the United States all these obligations, and pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the Mexicans $5,000,000 in return for the cession
of New Mexico, a part of which was claimed by
Texas. Finally Slidell was to purchase California, if
that were found to be possible, and raise the cash
payment from $5,000,000 to $25,000,000. Slidell's
mission was supported by a naval demonstration in
Mexican waters, and the meaning of his presence was
made very plain to the people of the distressed republic.</p>

<p>The new Minister was rejected, however, and
Taylor was ordered to move his troops toward the
Rio Grande. Mexico resented this, and near Matamoras
on April 24, 1846, came the first pass at
arms. Slidell returned to Washington about the
time that the news of this encounter reached the
President. On May 11, war was declared and Taylor
was ordered to cross the border and &ldquo;conquer a
peace.&rdquo; In August Colonel S. W. Kearny seized
New Mexico and set out with a troop of three hundred
men to take California. But Commodore John Drake
Sloat had been sent to the Pacific with a squadron
of the navy to prevent the seizure of Monterey by
the English. And to make certainty more certain,
Consul Thomas O. Larkin at Monterey had been instructed,
about the time of Slidell's appointment to
Mexico, to be in readiness for any emergency. Before
Kearny could cross the mountains, Larkin and
Sloat had taken possession of California, almost unresisted.</p>

<p>In September, 1846, General Taylor won a brilliant
victory at Monterey, twenty miles south of the
Rio Grande, and his forces were being augmented
every day for the march overland to the City of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Mexico. Whig politicians hailed at once the new
general as their candidate for the Presidency in
1848. Naturally the Administration did not care to
aid their opponents in their political plans, and its
leaders cast about for a Democratic general. None
was to be found; and Thomas H. Benton, willing
that Jackson's plan for his elevation to the Presidency
should be fulfilled, asked Polk to make him
commander-in-chief of all the forces operating in
Mexico. Benton had never had any military experience,
and Polk was relieved to find that such an
appointment would not be confirmed by the Senate.
General Winfield Scott, already quarreling with the
Secretary of War, and hence out of favor with the
Administration, was the only alternative. Scott was
also a candidate for the Whig nomination for the
Presidency. After much hesitation most of the troops
of Taylor were placed under the command of Scott
and reinforced with still others, and all set sail for
Vera Cruz, then as now the great port of Mexico.
The city fell on March 29, 1847, and the march to
the City of Mexico was about to begin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Santa Anna had been made commander
of all the Mexican armies, and he, learning
of Taylor's weak and isolated position south of Monterey,
hastened with twenty thousand soldiers to surround
and capture him. Taylor moved forward and
met the enemy at Buena Vista, after receiving some
raw recruits, on February 23, 1847, and completely
routed him, thus adding to the laurels he had already
won and convincing the country that he had been
badly treated by the authorities in Washington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Scott began the march to the Mexican capital on
April 8. He met resolute resistance at Cerro Gordo,
where on April 17 and 18 a large army of the enemy
was attacked and defeated. At this point Nicholas
Trist, envoy from the President, with instructions
to treat with Mexico on the basis of Slidell's proposals
of 1845, arrived. Trist was a clerk in the
Department of State, and Scott refused to recognize
or have any relations with him. After much unseemly
bickering and the conciliatory services of the British
Minister to Mexico, the general and the envoy made
peace, and negotiations were opened, only to be
broken off by Santa Anna upon his arrival from the
north. On August 19 and 20, the battle of Cherubusco
seemed to convince the Mexicans that further
resistance would be futile, and Trist again offered
peace on the terms of 1845, except that the United
States would reduce the amount of money to be paid
by $5,000,000. But the armistice under which the
negotiations had been renewed was broken, and on
September 8 and 13, the battles of Molino del Rey
and Chapultepec were fought, and the capital was
occupied on September 14. A revolution in the affairs
of Mexico now took place, and the new Government
appointed commissioners on November 22,
to treat with Trist.</p>

<p>However, the news of these battles and victories
had aroused the expansionist instincts of the people
of the United States, or at least of the articulate
classes, to the point of demanding the annexation of
the whole of Mexico. Sober newspapers, like the
New York <i>Evening Post</i>, officers of the navy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

the army, like Commodore Stockton and Colonel
Jefferson Davis, the hero of the battle of Buena
Vista, and leading politicians, John A. Dix, Lewis
Cass, and Secretary Walker, urged the Government
to make an end of Mexico by prompt dismemberment.
Although the election of Representatives in
1846 had resulted in giving the Whigs control of
the House, Congress seemed disposed to yield to the
popular clamor as they came together in December,
1847, when the news of the raising of the American
flag over the city of Mexico was fresh in the
public mind.</p>

<p>Polk found his Cabinet divided on the subject of
&ldquo;all Mexico,&rdquo; with the preponderance of influence
in favor of annexation. Buchanan gave out a public
letter in which he said, &ldquo;Destiny beckons us to hold
and civilize Mexico.&rdquo; Walker threatened to urge
the absorption of Mexico in his report to Congress.
The flag should never be hauled down from the ramparts
of the captured capital of Mexico. Polk resisted
this pressure, but he recalled Trist just before
the beginning of the final negotiations with Mexico.
On the advice of General Scott, Trist refused to obey
the President, and both he and the general hastened
the negotiations.</p>

<p>Although the Whigs were also infected with the
expansionist fever, Henry Clay came out of his retirement
at Ashland, near Lexington, and on November
13, made an impassioned appeal to the
country against the wickedness of despoiling a helpless
neighbor; John Quincy Adams, nearing the
end of his career, continued to denounce the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Mexican movement. But Webster, an ardent candidate
now for the Whig nomination in 1848, said
little and took this occasion to visit the South and
West. Calhoun made it his especial business in the
Senate to defeat what he thought was the President's
purpose, the annexation of all Mexico. But
the prospect of success of these &ldquo;little Americans&rdquo;

was far from bright.</p>

<p>When the Trist treaty, giving satisfaction on all
the points raised in Slidell's mission and selling to
the United States both California and New Mexico,
reached Washington in February, 1848, there was
every temptation to reject it. The ablest members
of the Cabinet insisted upon its rejection; a scheme
for the establishment of a protectorate over Yucatan,
which was expected to eventuate in annexation,
was being urged, and the rumors of approaching
convulsions in Europe were heartening leading members
of Congress. Why should not the United States
fulfill her destiny? There was none to interfere or
make afraid. Senator Foote, of Mississippi, urged
in glowing terms the advantages of &ldquo;extending
American liberty&rdquo; over Central America; Senator
Hannegan, of Indiana, fairly represented his section
when he said that the time had come for the
United States to take Canada, too, and make the
boundaries of North America the boundaries of the
great Republic; and Senator Cass was making his
campaign for the Democratic nomination on the plea
that the time was ripe for the extinguishment of the
remnants of European authority on the continent.</p>

<p>The President, worn out with the toils of office<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and determined not to seek renomination, decided
to accept the treaty, and the Senate, in spite of the
warmest harangues of the extremists, promptly approved
the work of Trist and Scott, for the general
had had much to do with the negotiations. The war
had come to an end, though there were still further
efforts to undo the treaty by seizing Yucatan, and
there was much complaint from leading Senators
and Representatives at the alleged weakness of
Polk.</p>

<p>At a cost of a few thousand lives and some eighty
million dollars, eight hundred thousand square miles
of territory had been added to the country and the
long-standing quarrel with Mexico about Texas had
been brought to an end. The Treasury had stood
well the heavy strain of war, every bond that had
been issued had been readily taken at par and on a
low rate of interest&mdash;an unprecedented fact in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
American history. The hard times of the preceding
decade seemed to be brought to a conclusion. No
one complained at the tariff, and even the veto of
the internal improvements bill was passing out of
the public mind. The South and the West had carried
their program. Polk retired to his home to die
a few months later. There had been no appreciable
public demand for his renomination; and, rather
strange to say, both the people and the historians
consigned him to comparative oblivion.</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>G. P. Garrison's <i>Westward Extension</i> (1906), in the <i>American
Nation</i> series, has given us the best brief general survey of the
expansion movement which closed with the war with Mexico. An
exhaustive treatment of the Texas question is Justin H. Smith's
<i>The Annexation of Texas</i> (1911), and George L. Rives's <i>The United
States and Mexico, 1821-1848</i> (1913), is almost as complete for the
Mexican War. A good history of Oregon and the Oregon movement
has not yet been written; but Robert Greenhow's <i>History of
Oregon</i> (1870), H. H. Bancroft's <i>Oregon</i>, in his voluminous Western
history series, and Josiah Royce's <i>California</i>, in the <i>American Commonwealths</i>

series, are all valuable. Some special articles of importance
are: <i>The Slidell Mission to Mexico</i>, by L. M. Sears, in

Mexico</i>, in the <i>Journal</i> of the Illinois State Historical Society for
1911. The sources which some may wish to consult are <i>The Diary

<h4>THE ABOLITIONISTS</h4>

<p>The overthrow of the Democratic party in 1848
was due, not to the ruthless exploitation of Mexico
nor to dissatisfaction with the new economic policy,
but to the abiding distrust of the aristocratic South
and its slavery system by the small business men and
farmers of the North. The greater the success of
Polk, the greater the danger to the older virtues of
the Republic, a simple life and faith in the ideals
of freedom and equality. As we have seen, the South
had given up these ideals, and the tobacco, cotton,
and sugar planters governed there with increasing
success and acceptability.</p>

<p>There had been persistent economic and religious
opposition to the growth of the plantation system.
In the closing years of the eighteenth century most
people in the South disliked slavery, and in Kentucky
majorities of the voters sustained the first abolition
movement of radical tendencies in the country;
but the excitement over the Alien and Sedition
Laws eclipsed at the critical moment the public interest
in the anti-slavery struggle. Other outcroppings
of the same hostility to slavery, as already
noted, were made evident in the meetings of Presbyterian
and Methodist church conferences between
1815 and 1825 in Maryland, western Virginia, Tennessee,
and North Carolina. But all these efforts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>

failed and the Southern abolitionists, as we have
seen, having &ldquo;fought the good fight,&rdquo; emigrated
to the Northwest about 1830, when Virginia failed
to rid herself of the growing &ldquo;incubus.&rdquo; Just as
Birney and Rankin &ldquo;took up arms&rdquo; in Ohio there
arose a fiercer champion of their cause in the East,
where distance from the scene, lack of intimate
knowledge of &ldquo;the system,&rdquo; and a strong popular
dislike of the South gave unwonted strength to the
new evangelism. William Lloyd Garrison, son of a
Massachusetts sea captain, was in a humor to reform
a world which &ldquo;sat in darkness.&rdquo; He declared negro
slavery the one great evil of his generation, and the
Federal Constitution, which protected it, &ldquo;an agreement
with Hell.&rdquo; After some ill-luck and untoward
experience in Baltimore, he set up in Boston, in
1831, his famous <i>Liberator</i>, in which he said he
would be heard, and henceforth his paper appeared
every week until the close of the Civil War. Every
scrap of news, true or untrue, which reflected the
cruelty of the slavery system, the lust of some brutal
master, or the growing power of the Southern States
in national politics he repeated and exploited. It was

&ldquo;yellow journalism&rdquo; in a peculiar sense. But a single
weekly paper published in Boston, where the commercial
and industrial interests had created an aristocracy
almost as exclusive as that of the South, could
hardly be expected to accomplish a great deal. The
other papers of the city would not publish his &ldquo;stories,&rdquo;
nor pay any attention to his earnest appeals.</p>

<p>He made another move upon the intrenched position
of the enemy. Between 1831 and 1835 he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
organized abolition societies, whose members took
vows to &ldquo;fight on and fight ever&rdquo; till success should
be attained. These societies were naturally numerous
in all those sections of New England, the Middle
States, and the Northwest where hostility and
even hatred to the masterful South prevailed. Pure
idealists, small farmers, village merchants, the unsuccessful,
and debtors who dreamed of an America of
which the Declaration of Independence speaks became
abolitionists. Orators were employed, speaking
campaigns were arranged, and the slogan was always
immediate and uncompensated abolition of negro
slavery. The more democratic churches were invaded
and their preachers were enlisted; or, when these resisted,
placarded as unfriendly to mankind. Before
1840 not less than fifteen thousand Methodists refused
association with other Methodists who would
not declare war on slavery. Nearly all of these lived
in western Massachusetts and upper New York.
These revolutionists carried their cause to the Methodist
General Conference in New York in 1844, and
the great Church was broken into two branches: a
Northern and a Southern. The Baptists of New England
refused the same year to support a missionary
who was also a slaveholder, and immediately the
Alabama Baptists refused to fellowship their Northern
brethren. The Southern Baptist Convention,
head of the denomination for all the Southern States,
was organized the next year at Augusta. The fact,
already noted, that both these sundered denominations
almost doubled their membership in the next
few years shows the strong sectionalism of the issue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did the public men of the North escape the
ordeal of ardent abolitionism. William H. Seward,
a conservative by nature, became an anti-slavery
Whig of national influence in 1843; Joshua R. Giddings,
of the Western Reserve, and Elijah P. Lovejoy,
of Illinois, accepted the agitator's commissions
and sought to unite the new idealism with the old
Americanism. But John Quincy Adams, who had
never been a democrat and who did not sympathize
with Garrison, became the arch-leader of the abolitionists
in Congress from 1836 to his death in 1848.
Smarting under the ill-treatment of Southern politicians,
it was easy for the able ex-President to become
the political exponent of the new anti-Southern
agitation. In no other country of that time could a
movement like American abolitionism have gained
such a hearing. In England the Government, that is
the people, never dreamed of destroying without
compensation the millions of property in the West
Indian slaves. But American abolitionists declared
that there could be no property in man, just as the
socialists say there can be no property in land. To
destroy outright the property which underlay the
Southern political power and the Southern aristocracy
was the aim of Garrison, and he found able
men, owners of large estates in the North, who were
willing to do what he urged.</p>

<p>Petitions asking the abolition of slavery in the
District of Columbia were presented to Congress by
John Quincy Adams in increasing numbers from
1831 to 1836. Southern men denied that the national
legislature had the power to destroy property<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
protected by the Constitution; Northern men, especially
representatives of the farmer districts, insisted
that the right of petition was fundamental to the
Constitution itself. There was a deadlock in Congress,
for the South controlled the Senate, while the
North controlled the House. In this state of things,
Southern legislatures formally denounced the abolition
movement as endangering the Union, and asked
Congress to protect them from the floods of abolition
literature which the United States mails carried
into communities where negro slaves were in the majority
and where insurrections were likely to occur.</p>

<p>In Charleston the people refused to allow the
postmaster to deliver the objectionable mail matter.
The subject was carried to President Jackson in
1835, and he decided that the uneasy masters of
South Carolina were justified in their protest. Calhoun,
like Adams in New England, became the
champion of his section, and devoted the remainder
of his life to a vain defense of slavery against the
&ldquo;foul slanders&rdquo; of anti-slavery agitators.</p>

<p>In May, 1836, after a fierce struggle in the House,
it was decided to lay upon the table without debate
all petitions which dealt with slavery. The right of
petition was thus formally denied, since a hearing is
the one thing prayed for in such documents. John
Quincy Adams declared that the rights of his constituents,
as guaranteed in the Constitution, were
thus abrogated. On the other hand, Calhoun declared
in the Senate, with equal truth, that the constitutional
rights of his constituents would be jeopardized
if the petitions were received and debated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>

Great excitement prevailed throughout the country,
for the contending sections were too strong for any
easy-going compromise to be possible. Keen observers
then visiting Washington wrote home that the
great Republic would go to pieces if either side won.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1837, Elijah P. Lovejoy was
murdered at Alton, Illinois, where he was trying to
publish, against the wishes of the people, an anti-slavery
weekly like Garrison's. And in Boston the
following December a young aristocrat, a Harvard
graduate and a promising lawyer, arose before a
large audience, before whom the Attorney-General
of the State had just been defending the Alton people
against attack, and declared that the &ldquo;earth should
have yawned and swallowed up&rdquo; the author of such
treasonable words. It was Wendell Phillips, and from
that day till the close of the bitter sectional struggle,
he was the greatest champion of immediate abolition,
the fervent orator who was ready to destroy
the Union in order to destroy slavery. Four years
after Phillips began his public career, Frederick
Douglass, escaping from a slave plantation in Maryland,
came into contact with Garrison, who at once
commissioned him an orator of abolition, and the
brilliant mulatto soon developed powers that gave
rise to jealous heartburnings among the leading
agitators. Lewis Tappan, Gerrit Smith, the Misses
Grimk&eacute;, born in South Carolina, and a host of other
enthusiastic democrats and idealists professed the new
faith. Contemptuous of Church and State, of union
and nationality, these apostles of the new cause laid
the foundations of the great sectional party which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
was later to bear the name Republican, thus appealing
to the memories of Jefferson and his followers of
1800.</p>

<p>It was this hostility of the sections, always dangerous,
but exceedingly so in 1836, when Texas was
asking admission as a slave State, that caused so
many of the best men of the time to talk freely of
the disruption of the Union. If Texas were annexed,
the East would secede; if it were not annexed, the
South would secede. Van Buren, the head of the
Democratic party, and Clay, the master of the Whigs,
exerted all their influence in 1844 to avoid the expected
conflict. But President Tyler, without close
party affiliations and standing in need of an issue,
was ready to take the risk. Radical expansionists,
supported by substantial economic interests in the
South, urged the immediate annexation of Texas,
while Adams and twenty-one of his colleagues from
the restless sections of the North declared that the
addition of the new region to the Union would be
equivalent to a dissolution of the ties which held the
warring sections together;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and they published, in
May, 1843, a formal address to their constituents
calling upon them to secede. The members of Congress
who signed this address represented the districts,
almost without exception, in which abolition had won
a footing.</p>

<p>The important question was: Should the East
remain passive while the annexation of &ldquo;another
Louisiana&rdquo; was being consummated and thus allow
herself to be submerged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles Sumner, an ambitious young man, an intellectual
kinsman of Wendell Phillips, one of those
&ldquo;transcendentalists&rdquo; of Massachusetts of whom the
country was to hear a great deal in the future, answered
this question in his famous &ldquo;grandeur-of-nations&rdquo;
oration of July 4, 1845. The &eacute;lite of Boston
had gathered for the occasion in Tremont Temple,
and they had invited the officers of a warship then
lying in the harbor, the local military men, and
others who took pride in the martial deeds of their ancestors,
to join in the accustomed celebration of the
Fourth. Dressed in gay, super-fashionable attire, the
young Sumner poured forth in matchless language
a denunciation of war, of military and naval armaments,
of President Polk and the party in power,
which drove one half of his audience frantic with resentment
and anger. &ldquo;There is no war which is honorable,
no peace which is dishonorable,&rdquo; he declared
at the outset, and for two hours he massed his arguments
and statistics to prove the thesis. The conservatives
of Boston declared that it would be the last
of the young man. But Garrison and Phillips had
raised up another recruit. The oration which had
insulted half of those who heard it was published in
edition after edition and distributed in the country
districts of the North. Sumner was ever after in
great demand as a speaker and anti-Southern agitator.
He would not, however, dissolve the Union to
escape slavery; he sought rather to mobilize the forces
which the abolitionists were stirring to activity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The war with Mexico came, victories were won,
and the national enthusiasm was running high when
President Polk asked Congress in August, 1846, to
vote him two million dollars in order that he might
have the means of inducing Mexico to make satisfactory
cessions of territory. The Western Democrats
were smarting under the sting of the veto of
their internal improvements bill, and the &ldquo;people at
home&rdquo; were much disappointed at the loss of half
of Oregon, &ldquo;given away,&rdquo; some said, by a President
who was only interested in &ldquo;Southern policies.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>

Jacob Brinkerhoff, who had had a quarrel with Polk
about the patronage, drew a proviso to be added to
the appropriation bill, which declared that slavery
should be forever forbidden throughout the proposed
accessions of territory. Judge Wilmot, a quiet
member from Pennsylvania, was induced to offer
the amendment. He awoke next day a famous man.</p>

<p>Northern Whigs who had been compelled by
popular sentiment to support the Administration in
all its war measures seized the opportunity to vote
for the proviso; of course the Northwestern Democrats,
who were dissatisfied because of other matters,
took this chance to pay the President for his neglect
of them. The abolitionists who were in politics became
more active, and many orthodox, that is non-voting,
followers of Garrison changed their views
and thenceforward fought in the ranks of party organization.
It was a critical time for the dominant
South. Only the conservative Senate saved the
President from a second unpopular veto. A strong
popular sentiment supported the proviso movement,
and when Congress reassembled in December the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
determination of the opposition to prevent the extension
of slavery into the new territory was stronger
than ever. The House attached the proviso to the
appropriation bill, which came up again, and the
Senate a second time defeated the anti-slavery
forces.</p>

<p>The South was by this time greatly excited, and
Virginia, South Carolina, and Alabama declared
that the passage of the proposed amendment would
be resisted to the point of making open war. In the
East and Northwest, where the abolitionists were
numerous, the leaders were equally resolute in their
purpose that slavery should not profit by the war
with Mexico. Horace Greeley, William H. Seward,
and Salmon P. Chase, a vigorous anti-slavery leader
of Ohio, who now came into national prominence,
were the most powerful spokesmen of the various
elements of the opposition, and they were actively
laying the foundations of an abolition and sectional
party which should ere long outvote the South.</p>

<p>The candidacy of Zachary Taylor, strongly supported
by Thurlow Weed, checked and even defeated
the sectional purposes of the radicals. Taylor
was the master of a great plantation in Louisiana,
and John J. Crittenden, of Kentucky, Ballard Preston,
of Virginia, and Alexander Stephens, of Georgia,
all good pro-slavery men, rallied at once to the popular
military chieftain. Clay was promptly snubbed
and Webster's claims were unceremoniously brushed
aside. The Whig Convention of 1848 met in Philadelphia
in May. It was under the control of Weed
and his Southern allies. Taylor was nominated, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Webster, Clay, and the other disgruntled leaders
finally gave him their support. Nothing was said of
the great issue, the spread of slavery over the new
accessions; and the party, as in 1840, went before
the country without a platform. Nor was the candidate
allowed to make speeches or write public letters,
which was doubtless wise, for Taylor knew
little of public questions. It was said that he had
never voted, and he claimed to belong to no party.
The Whigs took him on his reputation as a soldier
and on the recommendation of the great New York
&ldquo;boss.&rdquo; His candidacy probably saved the party
from breaking into two hostile wings.</p>

<p>When the Democratic Convention assembled in
Baltimore in May, 1848, Cass met with little opposition.
His stout imperialism had won him the
leadership of the expansionist West and South. The
radical pro-slavery men of the lower South, who
feared his former friendliness to the Wilmot Proviso
leaders, had been satisfied, with a few exceptions,
by the Nicholson letter of December, 1847,
in which Cass laid down the doctrine that the settlers
in any new region should be allowed to determine
for themselves whether they would have slaves or
not. It was the same idea which Douglas made
famous in his Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854, and
which the country then dubbed &ldquo;squatter-sovereignty.&rdquo;
Cass was nominated and the Nicholson
letter was made the platform; all the leaders of the
party gave him hearty support, save those who had
been humiliated at Baltimore four years before by
the defeat of Van Buren. Van Buren himself doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>less
remembered that Cass had lent assistance to the
astute Southern politicians who had compassed his
fall.</p>

<p>It was difficult to say which of the great parties
was the weaker, the Whigs with both Webster and
Clay sulking, or the Democrats with the shrewd Van
Buren awaiting his opportunity to punish his enemies.
The opportunity came in the nomination of
Van Buren by the Liberty Party Convention, which
met later in the summer at Syracuse. The Van
Buren wing of the New York Democracy approved
the Syracuse Convention, and the Free-Soil party
began its first and only campaign with the ex-President
as its candidate. Van Buren received nearly
300,000 votes in November and prevented Cass
from becoming President. He had avenged himself.
The South found her alliance with the Northwest
broken, but a Southern slave-owner was to be the
next President.</p>

<p>As so often happens in American history, the election
settled nothing, for the victorious Whigs, as in
1840, had no program, and their candidate had no
political record. When the Administration began its
work, it was found expedient to underwrite practically
all that the Polk Administration had accomplished.
There was no idea of reopening the bank or
financial questions; and the tariff was already so
successful that it would have been plain folly to
change it. In the foreign policy of the country the
Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with England dealt with the
proposed isthmian canal. By this agreement the two
contracting parties promised not to acquire further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
interests in Central America, and thus in a way nullified
the concessions of Colombia of 1846, under
which Polk had hoped for the building of a canal
across Panama.</p>

<p>The one absorbing question after the inauguration
of Taylor was that which both the great parties had
side-stepped during the campaign, namely, what
should be done with slavery in the Territories. The
Southern Whigs sought day and night to gain the
ear of the President, and the Southern Democrats
were not less persistent. Both aimed at the same
thing, the extension of their favorite institution.
And now that the fight for slavery in Oregon was
recognized as lost, this Southern wooing of the new
President became the more intense. It was a desperate
situation for the South. The Northwest was
rapidly expanding toward the Pacific and building
up free States which might at any time repudiate
their allegiance to the South. Now the Treaty of
Guadalupe-Hidalgo opened a great hinterland for
the South, extending by the easiest passes over the
mountains to California. But the abolitionists declared
that the South should not expand in that
direction save at the expense of slavery. The President's
attitude might determine the matter.</p>

<p>The discovery of gold in amazingly rich deposits
in California hastened the conflict of the rival sections.
During the second half of 1848 and all through
1849 thousands of Southerners, Easterners, and
Westerners rushed pell-mell into the new Eldorado,
bent on making hasty fortunes and oblivious of the
anxious thoughts of statesmen. The motley gold-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>diggers
needed government. They asked Polk to
provide it. He failed to grant it. Congress could
not do so because of the deadlock over slavery.
Benton wrote a public letter to the Californians advising
them to form a government for themselves,
and his son-in-law, John C. Fr&eacute;mont, went to the
new community to help the cause and perhaps to
come back to Washington as one of their Senators.
In 1849, the Californians formed a State Government,
and the new legislature sent their constitution
and two Senators, one of whom was Fr&eacute;mont, on to
Washington early the next year. Admission as a
full-fledged State was asked. They had failed to
mention slavery in their constitution.</p>

<p>President Taylor had at last decided to admit to
his counsels the anti-slavery leaders of the Whig
party, and he filled his Cabinet with men who would
support him as against Clay and Webster. William
H. Seward became the confidential adviser to the
President and a sort of Administration leader of the
Senate. Southern Whigs like Stephens, who had
done much to secure for Taylor the Presidency, were
without influence, and they feared that all the anti-slavery
elements of the North were combining to
control the Government.</p>

<p>While California was shaping her own course and
the President was making his decision as between
the factions of his party, South Carolina and Mississippi
took the lead in a movement to prevent that
or any other State or Territory from being brought
into the Union if slavery were not duly recognized.
Whigs and Democrats joined in great mass meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ings,
which showed conclusively that the lower South
was in earnest. All classes of the people united in
what seemed to be almost the unanimous wish of the
South, that the new Southwest should be preserved
for the expansion of slavery. These meetings spread
over all the lower Southern States, and as a result,
a convention was called to meet in Nashville in June,
1850. The object of this general convention was to
present to Congress a Southern ultimatum, and in
the event that this should not be heeded, to urge
the secession of the slaveholding States.</p>

<p>In the West the crisis did not seem so acute. But
Clay, now seventy-four years old, and cured of his ambition
to be President, was sent back to the Senate in the
hope of averting the calamity of a disruption of the
Union. Thomas H. Benton, though recently defeated
in a campaign for re&euml;lection, was still in the Senate.
Cass was again a member of the Senate, and he, too,
felt that the Union was about to be dissolved.
Douglas and the other younger representatives of
the Northwest, who had suffered somewhat from the
legislation of 1846, ceased to nurse their grievances
against the party, and deplored the &ldquo;treason&rdquo; of
the abolitionists who were making all the trouble.
There was undoubtedly a crisis which Southern leaders
like Davis, Stephens, Yancey, and Robert Toombs,
another able Georgian who now came into national
prominence, took pains to lay to the charge of the
radical anti-slavery people of the East; that is, to
Seward and his followers, who were allowing Garrison
and Phillips and the radical abolitionists to drive
them into open opposition to the South.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>When Clay came back to Washington, Taylor and
his Cabinet had taken their stand, which was to recommend
the admission of California as a free State.
The Mormons in Deseret and a few Americans and
Mexicans in New Mexico had taken steps toward
organizing Territories in the region between Texas
and eastern California, and they were to be made
Territories with or without slavery, as they chose. If
all this were done, the South would secede and the
Administration would be in a dilemma. Taylor was
a stubborn man; he had made up his mind, and he
sent to Congress a fatherly message in which his
devotion to the Union above everything else was
very evident. If the Southerners, who were then
offering Texas military assistance to make good her
claim to a large part of New Mexico, chose to resist
the lawful authority of the Administration and war
came, the fault would be theirs, not his.</p>

<p>But Henry Clay and Daniel Webster still enjoyed
much more of the confidence of the people of the
country, North and South, than the President. Nor
was Webster less popular because he had been ignored
by the Administration. He was in his place in
the Senate. Calhoun was also there. It was an exceedingly
able Congress, that to which Taylor and
Seward must look for support. With scant courtesy
to the President, Clay took the lead in the Senate
late in January and offered his plan of compromising
the sectional quarrel. He would make a free State of
California, allow Utah, as Deseret came to be called,
and New Mexico to form Territorial Governments
without mention of slavery, pay Texas ten million<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
dollars for her claims against New Mexico, abolish
the slave trade in the District of Columbia, and enact
a Fugitive Slave Law which would satisfy the
border Southern States.</p>

<p>Excitement was too intense for the two parties in
the Senate and House to accept immediately this
comprehensive plan. The President opposed it; the
extreme men of the South opposed it. But Clay had
not lost his power to charm, and he was still a good
manager, according to the polite phraseology of the
day. He quietly secured the support of Thomas
Ritchie, editor of the Democratic organ at Washington,
<i>The Union</i>; he broke the hold of Calhoun
on Mississippi by winning to his side Senator
Henry S. Foote, a fiery Democrat and foremost advocate
of Southern resistance; and within the next
three months most of the Southern Whigs who were
preparing to take part in the Nashville convention
indicated their change of heart. Clay's method, almost
exactly parallel to that by which Jackson had
defeated Calhoun in 1833, was to steal away the
hearts of Whigs and Westerners, to whom the Union
was still sacred, and leave the radical South isolated.
And in support of his compromise the old statesman
made most moving appeals during February and
March. It was the greatest moment of his life, he
thought, and in this his colleagues were fully agreed.</p>

<p>But Calhoun and the ardent representatives of
the lower South, supported by nearly all of the
spokesmen of Virginia and North Carolina, were
the obstacles in the way of a settlement. They demanded
a slave State in California and free access,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
under the protection of the Union, to all the new
Mexican territory. The extension of the Missouri
Compromise line to the Pacific would have satisfied
them. Or failing in this, Calhoun asked for an amendment
to the Federal Constitution which should
create a dual presidency in which each section was
always to have a veto over the legislation of Congress.
Permanent deadlock was thus proposed as
the remedy for the ills of sectional conflict. Resolute
as the old nationalist was, he could not bring himself
in these closing days of his life to pronounce to his
party the word &ldquo;secession.&rdquo; It was pathetic to see
the disappointed and broken leader of the South as
he literally wore his life away trying to defeat Clay,
his lifelong antagonist, or to conciliate Webster, for
whom he had always entertained a hearty respect.</p>

<p>Upon Webster and his conservative Eastern support
depended the outcome. He had never been a
democrat, and as he had grown older, he had come
to sympathize more than formerly with the great
property interests of the South, which were not unlike
the industrial interests of the East, for which he
had broken many a lance. He, too, had been a rival
of Clay since 1832, and three times a disappointed
candidate for the Whig nomination for the Presidency.
But both he and Clay had been brushed
aside in 1848 by Thurlow Weed and the young William
H. Seward with rather scant ceremony. And
the abolitionists of New England were as noisome to
him as were the radical secessionists to Henry Clay.
Charles Sumner and his friends were already waging
incessant war upon him. He took his stand on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>

March 7, and he made the day famous. He spoke for
the Union, and the effect of the speech was probably
the postponement of the Civil War. Although he was
again the follower of Clay, he was henceforth &ldquo;the
Godlike Webster&rdquo; to Northern conservatives, and the
large business interests of his section applauded him
more heartily than they had ever done before. But
the price which he paid for this epoch-making speech
was fearful. The Massachusetts abolitionists groaned
at the mention of his name, and the poet Whittier
pilloried him in the famous lines:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        &ldquo;So fallen! So lost! the light withdrawn
                 Which once he wore!
         The glory from his gray hairs gone
                 Forever more!
         Revile him not&mdash;the Tempter hath
                 A snare for all;
         And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath,
                 Befit his fall.&rdquo;

<p>Clay had won. The President, resisting to the
last and following the counsels of Seward, saw the
majority of Congress yield slowly to influences which
favored compromise. Calhoun died early in April,
and though his followers maintained their position
resolutely, their Whig allies were deserting them,
and the Nashville convention proved a fiasco when it
assembled in June. President Taylor died on the 9th
of July, and the last obstacle to the success of Clay
and Webster was removed. Millard Fillmore, the
Vice-President, a close friend of Clay, became President;
the Cabinet was reorganized, Webster becoming
Secretary of State. One by one during the month of
August all the features of the &ldquo;Omnibus Bill&rdquo; became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>

law. The great majority of the Southerners indicated
their ready acceptance of the compromise as a
&ldquo;finality&rdquo;; and radicals like Jefferson Davis, Robert
Barnwell Rhett, and William L. Yancey retired from
public life, either voluntarily or by compulsion of the
people. The big cities of the East and the Northwest
celebrated the passage of the crisis with the firing
of cannon, and everywhere the thanks of the people
were expressed to the &ldquo;great Congress&rdquo; which had
saved them from civil war.</p>

<p>If the logic of events ever pointed to one individual
as the proper leader of the people or the fit
man for the Presidency, it pointed to Daniel Webster
in 1852. The Whigs had not all voted for the compromise,
but their leaders had been its authors. The
party was entitled to claim the glory for a great performance;
and if they claimed it and nominated their
candidate upon a platform of &ldquo;henceforth there shall
be peace between the sections,&rdquo; they would undoubtedly
win and control the Federal Government for at
least two or three presidential terms.</p>

<p>But with a most remarkable aptitude for blundering,
the Whigs in their convention of 1852 hesitated
in their pronouncement upon the compromise, and
refused to nominate Webster. The radical element
procured the nomination of General Winfield Scott,
a Southern man of anti-slavery proclivities, and Scott
blundered through the campaign, losing votes every
time he made a public statement. Heart-broken, the
&ldquo;Godlike Webster&rdquo; died before the day of election.
Nor was Clay spared to witness the crushing defeat
which awaited his beloved party in November. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>

Whig newspapers of that autumn appeared in mourning
too frequently for the public mind not to be
affected.</p>

<p>Conservative interests turned to the Democratic
party, whose leaders promptly declared in their convention
that the compromise was a finality. They
nominated a popular but colorless young New Englander,
Franklin Pierce, a colonel under Scott in the
war with Mexico, and Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote
the campaign biography. Pierce said little during
the months of electioneering. His r&ocirc;le and that of
his party was now one of conciliation. If elected he
would enforce the laws and maintain the Union.
Every State but four, Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky,
and Tennessee, gave him their electoral votes.
The support of the Free-Soil Democrats, 156,000
votes and all in the abolitionist sections, showed that
the country was tired of agitation. The prolonged
quarrel of the sections seemed definitely closed, and
the future promised peace and prosperity.</p>

<h4>PROSPERITY</h4>

<p>Partisan opposition to Franklin Pierce had almost
disappeared before the day of his inauguration in
1853. Charles Sumner, to be sure, was in the Senate,
but he was a silent member, and Massachusetts inclined
to follow Edward Everett rather than Sumner.
William H. Seward still spoke for the anti-slavery
Whigs in Congress, and Salmon P. Chase maintained
a precarious hold on Ohio. There was a handful of
Free-Soilers in the House of Representatives who
were ready to make trouble for the new Administration,
and resistance to the enforcement of the
Fugitive Slave Law now and then broke out in riots
in certain neighborhoods of New England and in the
Western Reserve. But the opposition was everywhere
declining until Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's
famous novel, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, with its exaggerated
emphasis upon the cruelties of the slavery system,
began to stir the consciences of men. Even so there
was no substantial evidence that any great political
upheaval or party change would occur within the next
fifteen or twenty years. The people were contented
with their country, and the growth of the population
gave evidence of a great future.</p>

<p>When Jackson came to the Presidency there were
about 12,500,000 people in the country; in 1850 the
number had grown to 23,000,000, and in 1860 there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>

were 31,000,000. The Census Bureau estimated that
the population of 1900 would be 100,000,000 if
the growth of the Pierce period was maintained.
Not only was the normal native increase phenomenal,
but foreigners poured into &ldquo;the land of the free&rdquo; in
unprecedented numbers. In 1850 there were 2,800,000
foreign-born people in the United States; in
1860 there were 5,400,000, and this tide of immigration
was of a very high social and economic character.
The German element was large, industrious, and
liberty-loving, many of them being refugees from the
political persecutions of 1832-33 and 1848-50. The
English, Scotch, and Irish composed most of the remainder,
and these were already familiar with the
ideals and political habits of the country and therefore
readily assimilable. By far the greater part of
this rich contribution to American life fell to the
cities of the East and the open country of the Northwest,
where good land was abundant and available at
low prices.</p>

<p>If we compare the distribution of the population
of 1850-60 with that of 1830, we shall see how well
the sectional balance, on which so much depended,
was maintained. In 1830, the East<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> had a population
of 6,000,000 in a total of almost 13,000,000.
This had increased only 500,000 in 1850; but between
1850 and 1860 the increase was nearly 2,000,000.
The South had a population of 6,000,000 in
1830; in 1850, 8,900,000, and in 1860 this had
grown to 11,400,000. The Northwest had, however,
grown faster than either of the other sections, for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
increase, including California and Oregon, had been
from 4,800,000 in 1850 to 8,260,000 in 1860; that
is, the growth of the East during the last decade of
<i>ante-bellum</i> history was 21 per cent, that of the
South, 28 per cent, and that of the Northwest, 77
per cent.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the sectional conditions of 1830
as set forth in the third chapter of this volume, we
shall come to a better understanding of the Civil
War if the prosperity of the different parts of the
Union be closely analyzed. The people of the United
States were poor indeed in 1830 as compared with
1850-60. Between 1815 and 1846 the receipts of
the Federal Treasury fluctuated violently; but from
that date to 1860, except for two years of panic,
the Federal Treasury was always full and there was
generally an annual surplus of from $5,000,000 to
$10,000,000. During the Jacksonian era the prices
of staple commodities fluctuated as much as fifty per
cent in single years. Cotton was twenty cents a
pound during all of the twenties; it was as low as
seven cents when nullification was the critical issue;
but from 1850 to 1860 cotton sold at ten or twelve
cents. Corn was in most places twenty-five cents a
bushel during Jackson's and Van Buren's Administrations;
between 1850 and 1860 it rose in price
steadily and was almost everywhere readily marketable
at fifty cents a bushel. In the era just preceding
the war prices were steadily rising, and the
demand for American produce, cotton, corn, tobacco,
wheat, and sugar, was always greater than the supply.</p>

<p>This prosperity was unequally distributed, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
always. The East had developed her manufactures
beyond all expectation, and the great mill belt
stretched from southeastern Maine to New York
City, its center of gravity, thence to Philadelphia
and Baltimore, and from these cities westward to
Pittsburg. Another belt ancillary to this began in
western Massachusetts and extended along the Erie
Canal to Buffalo, thence to Cleveland, Detroit, and
Chicago. In these areas, or in the industrial belt as
it may be termed, there lived about 4,000,000 mill
operatives, whose annual output of wool, iron, and
cotton manufactures alone was worth in 1860 $330,393,000
as compared to the $58,000,000 of 1830.
Perhaps the meaning of these figures may become
clearer if we note that the total investments in these
industries was considerably less than the yearly product.
Nor was the East less prosperous in other lines.
Her tonnage had increased from a little more than
500,000 in 1830 to nearly 5,000,000 in 1860. The
freight and passenger ships, built of iron, and encouraged
by liberal subsidies from the Federal Government,
employed 12,000 sailors and paid their
owners $70,000,000 a year. They carried the manufactures
of the East to the Southern plantations, to
South America, and to the Far East. This great fleet
of commercial vessels was owned almost exclusively in
Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, and its
owners were at the end of the decade about to wrest
from Great Britain her monopoly of the carrying
trade of the world.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

<p>In spite of the efforts of President Jackson and of
the purposes of the sub-treasury system, the concentration
of capital in the Eastern towns and cities continued.
Only New York, instead of Philadelphia,
was the new center. The merchants of that city imported
three fourths of the European goods consumed
in the country, and they in turn exported nearly all
of the great crops with which the balance of trade
was maintained. New York was also a distributing
center for the manufactures of the East which were
sent to the South, the West, or the outside world.
Thus the exchanges of all the sections were made
there, and before 1860 its banks, with a capital of
$130,000,000 and specie reserves of only $20,000,000,
did a business of $7,000,000,000 a year. And
while New York became the American London, the
whole of the East was likewise securing the lion's
share of the banking profits of the country. Although
the assessed wealth of the section counted
only one fourth of the total $16,000,000,000 for the
country in 1860, the East had nearly two thirds of
the banking capital; and the money in circulation
there was $16.5 <i>per capita</i> as against $6.6 for the
country as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Industry, commerce, shipping,
and banking concentrated in the narrow area of less
than 200,000 square miles, earned yearly returns
equal as a rule to the total of the capital invested.
Money changed hands rapidly, credits did the work
of capital, and the rapid growth of population added
large unearned increments to the fortunes of those who
owned land or had established themselves in trade.</p>

<p>Naturally this concentration of industry and the
economic resources of the country in the East led to
the rapid extension of railways into the West and
South. The New York Central, the Erie, the Pennsylvania,
and the Baltimore and Ohio systems had
already been founded, and they made connections in
1850-53 with the canals and railways of the Middle
West. The Illinois Central, which connected the
lower South with Chicago, was affiliated by means of
interlocking directorates with the New York Central
before 1856. John M. Forbes, the Boston capitalist,
was president of the Michigan Central during
the decade, and laying the foundations of the Chicago,
Burlington &amp; Quincy. Commodore Vanderbilt
was organizing his steamboat and railroad properties
and expanding the area of his activities till it
reached, before 1860, the rich grain belt of the West,
the cotton lands of the South, the Far Eastern trade
<i>via</i> his Panama Railroad and Pacific steamers, and
the great markets of Europe. During the decade
under consideration the capitalists of the East built
4000 miles of railway east of Pittsburg, 7500 miles
in the Northwest, and 5000 miles in the South. But
the work was not all done at the expense of the capitalists.
The Federal Government donated 20,000,000
acres of the most valuable lands in the country
to the companies which built the roads; States, counties,
and towns in the West and South voted many
millions for the same purpose; and European capitalists
loaned $450,000,000 secured by first mortgage
bonds on the vast properties.</p>

<p>Thus the industrial belt of the East was reaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
out toward Chicago, St. Louis, and New Orleans and
beyond for a commerce that was already richer than
the gold mines of California; and New York, Boston,
Philadelphia, the canal towns, and Pittsburg
were becoming centers of wealth and economic power
which attracted the attention of the world. Great
merchants, like the Lawrences of Boston and the
Astors of New York, became the objects of emulation
everywhere, and they in turn set the fashion of
giving liberally of their means to the cause of education
or the founding of hospitals, which has been a
distinctive feature of the social history of the last
thirty years.</p>

<p class="mid"><a href="images/226-large.jpg">Click to enlarge</a>, <a href="#MAPS">Click to return to Maps list</a></p>

<p>The planters, on the other hand, had spread their
system over the lower South in a remarkable manner
since 1830. From eastern Virginia their patriarchal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>

establishments had been pushed westward and southwestward
until in 1860 the black belt reached to the
Rio Grande. Tobacco, cotton, and sugar were still
their great staples, and the annual returns from these
were not less than $300,000,000; while the growth
of their output between 1850 and 1860 was more
than one hundred per cent. The number of slaves
who worked the plantations had increased between
1830 and 1860 from 2,000,000 to nearly 4,000,000
souls, thus suggesting the comparison with the workers
in the mills of the East. The exports of the black
belt composed more than two thirds of the total exports
of the country; but they were largely billed
through Eastern ports, and most of the imports of
the South came through New York, where a second
toll was taken from the products of the plantation.</p>

<p>But the ratio of annual returns to the total investments
was very unlike that of the East. In the South
the assessed value of real estate and personal property,
including slaves, in 1860 was $5,370,000,000,
while the returns for the best years were somewhat
over $300,000,000: that is, their investment was
$1,000,000,000 greater than that of the East and
their income not more than a third as great. Perhaps
the banking statistics of the planter section will
enable us to get a better view of their dependence
upon the East. The South had in 1860 a banking
capital of $89,131,000, a bank-note circulation of
$68,344,000, and money on deposit, $56,342,000.
Thus an annual return of $300,000,000 brought
deposits of only $56,000,000; and the <i>per capita</i>
circulation was only $10. New York City alone had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
twice as much money on deposit as all the Southern
States, though the personal property valuation of the
whole State of New York, with a population four
times as great, was only $320,000,000 as against
$240,000,000 for Virginia.</p>

<p>Although the system of agriculture in the South
had not greatly improved since 1830, the annual
crops sold for about four times as much as they had
brought when Jackson was President. In spite of
the &ldquo;red gullies&rdquo; and the waste lands, the owners
of plantations were the wealthy men of the time.
The Hairstons of Virginia and the Aikens of South
Carolina were counted as the peers of the Astors of
New York. But a Southern man worth $4,000,000
or $5,000,000 would not receive an annual income
of more than $100,000 unless he happened to be in
the midst of a new cotton region. Still the hold of
the planters on the state and county governments of
the South was, as we have seen in a former chapter,
even more secure than it had been in 1830, and
Southern public opinion was almost always the
opinion of the planters. Yet there was great uneasiness
in the South as to the future, and public
officials, railway magnates, and newspaper men gathered
in annual conventions to devise ways and
means of increasing the power of the South and of
competing with the East in the race for economic
supremacy.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

<p>These conventions discussed scientific agriculture,
the proper size of a plantation, and the duties of
&ldquo;Christian masters to their servants&rdquo;; they outlined
plans for connecting Southern ports with the
Northwest, for opening a direct trade with Europe,
and for annexing territory which might increase the
area of the staple producing States. They supported
Narciso Lopez and John A. Quitman in their filibustering
expeditions against Cuba, and they heralded
William Walker, who sought to make Nicaragua
an American slave State in 1854-59, as a
statesman and &ldquo;man of destiny.&rdquo; The reopening of
the African slave trade was the subject of long and
earnest debate, and Southern delegations in Congress
were urged to exert themselves to secure a repeal of
the law against the slave trade in order that the South
might have some means of increasing its laboring population
to counterbalance the advantages which the
East and Northwest derived from immigration. A
paramount purpose of these gatherings was to solidify
the South and to harmonize the interests of the
border States with those of the lower South. In the
background of all this, and especially after the struggle
over the Kansas-Nebraska Bill in 1854, there
was the ever-recurring probability of secession from
the Union.</p>

<p>What added to the anxieties of Southern leaders
was the extraordinary growth and expansion of the
Northwest. In 1830 it had been the East that most
feared the development of the Mississippi Valley;
now it was the South that took pains to hedge and
limit the opportunities of the newer States. And
there was reason for the masterful politicians of the
cotton country to watch the Northwestern frontier.
Michigan had become a State in 1837, Iowa and
Wisconsin in 1846, and Minnesota was to enter the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Union in 1858. There were four Territories, Kansas,
Nebraska, Oregon, and Washington, that might
be admitted at any time. California was growing
powerful, and she was already lost to slavery if not
to the South. And a free State was likely to be
formed in Colorado. Seven thriving Northwestern
States and five promising Territories gave every assurance
that the seat of political influence was about
to be shifted to the upper Mississippi Valley. Moreover,
the economic changes that were taking place
in that region were such as might have alarmed conservative
men both South and East.</p>

<p>The removal of the Indians from Michigan, Indiana,
and Illinois had paralleled the similar removal
from the lower South. But during the fifties, Iowa,
Wisconsin, and Minnesota succeeded in pushing the
natives into the arid Nebraska Territory. And now
as the great &ldquo;American Desert&rdquo; proved to be desirable
country for the pioneers, it was proposed to
shift the Northwestern Indians into the Southern
hinterland, now known as Oklahoma, and thus to
bar the way of the planter civilization to New Mexico
and California.</p>

<p>An equally important factor in the development
of the Northwest was the invention and manufacture
of grain-planting and harvesting machinery by Cyrus
McCormick and others about 1845. This enabled
the farmers to increase their operations very much
as the Whitney gin had done for the cotton farmers
of 1800. Still the transportation of wheat and corn
is so difficult that no great revolution would have
been possible but for the simultaneous building of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
thousands of miles of railways which opened to grain
production the vast prairie lands remote from the
rivers. The manufacture of farm implements and
the building of railroads made the Northwest a staple-producing
area of greater importance than the
South had been, though this was recognized by only
a few men before the beginning of the Civil War.</p>

<p>The value of the wheat and corn crops of the
Northwest increased from $80,000,000 in 1850 to
$225,000,000 in 1860. In addition to this the Northwest
produced pork in great quantities for the cotton
plantations, and fresh meats for the industrial cities
of the East. The railways, of which mention has
already been made, thus brought the isolated farmers
of the Western interior into close contact with the
markets of the world, and the Northwest was fast becoming
the food-producing region of the country and
at the same time exporting grain worth at least
$50,000,000 a year. In New York, Pennsylvania,
and other Eastern States the corn and wheat output
steadily declined between 1850 and 1860, while the
up-country of the South failed to produce the foodstuffs
needed by the planters. Thus the manufacturing
and the older staple-producing States came to
rely on the Northwest for a large part of their provisions.</p>

<p>Western farmers were now well-to-do. They deserted
their log cabins and built frame houses; they
bought large quantities of the finer goods of the East.
Pianos made in Germany and silks from France
found their way to Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa. Villages
became towns and towns grew rapidly into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
cities. Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Chicago
imitated the ways and manners of Boston and New
York. It was a busy, ambitious life that animated
the West and produced industrial leaders like Cyrus
McCormick, William B. Ogden, and John Y. Scammon,
and politicians like Stephen A. Douglas, Salmon
P. Chase, and the Dodges of Iowa and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>But in this busy region with its self-sufficing agriculture,
the actual surplus capital, as in the South,
found its way to Eastern cities. With a population
of nearly 8,000,000 and foreign exports of more than
$50,000,000, the Northwest still had only $10,425,000
on deposit in her banks and $27,000,000 invested in
banking enterprises. Her <i>per capita</i> circulation
was only $4. Here as in the South the amount
of specie in the banks was twice as great in proportion
to population and the volume of business transacted
as in the East. The debts of the Northwest to
the East and to Europe cannot well be estimated,
but they were enormous. States, counties, and corporations
owed hundreds of millions, and when the
interest on these obligations was paid at the end of
each year, the remaining net increase was small indeed.
The West had been badly in debt during the
Jackson period; it was still in debt.</p>

<p>While the growing Northwest owed more to the rest
of the world than it was likely to pay in half a century,
its leaders saw that it must continue to expand its area
and improve its economic life. Undoubtedly the one
leader who best understood the needs of his region
was Stephen A. Douglas, Senator from Illinois and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
perpetual candidate for the office of President of the
United States. Young, active, and ardently patriotic,
Douglas had been among the first to see during the Polk
Presidency that the old Western policy of internal
improvements and freer lands for all who might come
must be changed. The West, even the Northwest,
was firmly attached to the Democratic party; but the
center of that great organization was the South. The
leaders of that section looked more and more to free
trade as a national policy. If they succeeded, as there
was every reason to expect they would succeed, there
would be no more easy money for the building of
canals and roadways. Moreover, the South was now
jealous of the expanding Northwest, and her leaders
were growing more hostile toward the idea of free
lands for the Northwestern settlers.</p>

<p>Douglas and his friends in both houses of Congress
worked out a new policy during the years 1845
to 1850. It was to induce the Federal Government
to give large tracts of public land to the Northwestern
States on condition that they be given again by the
States to railroad corporations as aids to the building
of new lines. The roads would sell their lands
at good prices, the Government would sell its remaining
lands at high prices after the building of the
roads, and the farmers would cheerfully pay these
higher prices if markets for wheat and corn could be
created. The leaders of the lower South were interested
in this new American system, for there was
government land in their States and they needed railroads
quite as much as the Northwesterners. Capitalists
of the East and Europe would be enlisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
because the great tracts of rich land would be security
for money they might lend at high rates to the
roads. Finally, the increasing armies of immigrants
gave assurance that the railroad lands could be sold
easily.</p>

<p>The outcome was the building of the Illinois Central,
the Mobile and Ohio, and other shorter lines in
each of the Western and Northwestern States during
the decade of 1850-60. The railroad lands sold as
high as $8 or $10 an acre, and the government lands
advanced in value accordingly, though the Federal
Treasury did not profit to the full extent of these
promises. The growth and expansion of the Northwest
described above was due largely to this policy
of Douglas. Chicago bankers loaned all the money
they had and borrowed all they could borrow for the
building of railroads. The thriving young city, always
the pet of Senator Douglas, increased its business in
marvelous manner during the decade. It soon distanced
St. Louis in the race for wealth and population,
and before 1854 conceived of the scheme of
building a great railway, long ago proposed by Asa
Whitney, of Michigan, to the Pacific. This road was
to connect with the Illinois Central in Iowa, thread
its way through the Indian lands in Nebraska, and
finally bring San Francisco and the Far East into
touch with the commercial center of the Middle West.
It was a magnificent undertaking, not unlike that of
the Erie Canal, which had made New York the Emporium
of the East; it was even more daring for a
section already in debt to the limit of its ability to
pay. But these ambitious Northwestern men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
politicians had already won the support of the railway
men of New York and Boston, and their agents
still borrowed money with ease in London and Liverpool.
And with States like Illinois, Wisconsin, and
Iowa doubling their population each decade, and
hence increasing their land values three or fourfold,
even the impossible became possible. The most ambitious
section of the Union during the Pierce Administration
was the Northwest, and it need not
surprise us to learn that Douglas, her mouthpiece,
was the most ambitious leader of his party.</p>

<p>As compared with all former standards, the country
of 1850-60 was exceedingly prosperous. A series
of good crop years, the low tariff of the United
States, and the free-trade policy of England stimulated
the unprecedented commercial activity. The
financial system was more stable than it had ever been
before, and the inter-sectional trade was assuming
proportions never dreamed of in the earlier days of
the Republic. The manufactures of the East, which
approximated $800,000,000 in value each year, were
sold to the South in exchange for bills on Liverpool
or London, or to the West in return for its grain
and other foodstuffs. The banks and railroads brought
all sections closer together, especially the East and
the West; while the expanding merchant marine
promised soon to give the United States the mastery
of international commerce.</p>

<p>Thus the East had learned to prosper without a
high tariff, and the South was voting for large subsidies
to Eastern shipping. The West had found a
way to develop her resources in spite of Southern and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>

Eastern jealousy, and the laws of commerce were daily
weakening the influence of state rights and sectional
dislike. A new era had begun. Big business interests
and great railway schemes had developed the corporation
in its modern connotation; large harvests and
a most enterprising industry were producing the
capital for a new economic era; and all the social
tendencies seemed to be working out a national life
which was no longer parochial. It was the business
of politics so to guide and regulate the varying activities
of the people that sectional hatreds should pass
away and that the resources of the country should not
be squandered. Such was the task of Franklin Pierce,
the new leader, who had not known personally the
fears and dislikes of earlier days. But a country so rich
and prosperous as the United States in 1850-60 had
other interests, a social and intellectual life which
must engage our attention before we take up the
political evolution of the period.</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>James Ford Rhodes's <i>History of the United Slates</i>, vols. <span class="smcap">I</span> and <span class="smcap">II</span>,
already mentioned, remains the best treatment of the period of
1850-60. T. C. Smith's <i>Parties and Slavery</i>, in <i>American Nation</i>

series (1906), and McMaster's <i>History of the United States</i>, vol.
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>, are very valuable. T. P. Kettell's <i>Southern Wealth and Northern
Profits</i> (New York, 1860), is a suggestive study in sectionalism
not too well known to scholars. But the <i>Census Reports</i> of 1850
and 1860; J. E. B. DeBow's <i>Industrial Resources of the South and
West</i> (1857); and U.S. Senate <i>Executive Documents</i>, no. 38, part 1,
52d Cong., 1st Sess., supply the needful statistics on population,
crops, manufactures, and finance. Freeman Hunt's <i>Lives of
American Merchants</i>, 2 vols. (New York, 1858), gives some interesting
information about leading <i>ante-bellum</i> merchants and manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>facturers.
And the volumes of <i>Hunt's Merchant's Magazine</i>, 1839-60,

<h4>AMERICAN CULTURE</h4>

<p>Four fifths of the people of the United States of
1860 lived in the country, and it is perhaps fair to
say that half of these dwelt in log houses of one or
two rooms. Comforts such as most of us enjoy daily
were as good as unknown. Even in the cities baths
were exceedingly rare, while in the country the very
decencies of life were neglected. Mosquitoes, flies,
and other germ-harboring pests were regarded with
equanimity, screens and disinfectants being used only
in the best of hospitals. Malaria, typhoid, and other
diseases claimed a large toll upon life each year.
Physicians were less numerous than now and their
art was only in its infancy. Trained nurses were just
coming into their present r&ocirc;le. Men regarded sickness
as a visitation of Providence, and when the yellow
fever epidemics seized the lower Southern cities,
the losses and suffering were such as the present generation
cannot appreciate.</p>

<p>Improvements in the matter of dress since 1830
were evident, but for the workaday world shirtsleeves,
heavy brogan boots and shoes, and rough
wool hats were, of course, the rule. Salt bacon and
&ldquo;greens,&rdquo; with corn bread and thin coffee, composed
the common diet, though milk and butter relieved the
monotonous fare for the farmers. &ldquo;Hog-killing time&rdquo;

was always a happy season, for fresh meats were then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
abundant. Only in the larger towns did the people
have fresh meats throughout the year. An explanation
of the enthusiasm of <i>ante-bellum</i> people for political
speaking is found in the fact that barbecues
either preceded or followed the oratory; and to a
man who had lived for months on fat bacon and corn
bread a fresh roast pig was a delight which would enable
him to endure long hours of poor speaking. But
in the cities and towns there was, of course, a better
life. Frame houses, two stories high, painted white
and adorned with green window blinds, were everywhere
in good form, except where men were able to
build brick or stone mansions or maintain the establishments
of wealthy ancestors. In the South it was
still the custom to guard the entrances to great plantation
houses with chiseled lions or crouching greyhounds;
in the East more attention was paid to
flowers and shrubbery. Wealthy families of the East
sometimes maintained more than one house servant,
but the greater number counted themselves eminently
respectable with cook, maid, and house girl all in
one, and the pay was one or two dollars a week.
Liveries and silver plate persisted mainly in the very
exclusive circles of Philadelphia and New York, in
Washington, and on the great plantations.</p>

<p>Factory hands and common laborers worked twelve
hours a day under circumstances and conditions
hardly better than those of 1830, for labor unions
had only begun their agitation, and foreign immigrants
were always ready to accept work without
asking any questions. One or two States had passed
laws regulating hours of labor; but none had thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of the cost to the race of hard toil and long hours for
women and children, and most men regarded the
builder of a mill as a public benefactor because he
furnished employment to just this element of the
population. A man who had steady work on a farm
was paid from ten to fifteen dollars a month with
board; a day-laborer received a dollar a day without
perquisites. Skilled laborers were paid two dollars a
day in the South and slightly less in the East. The
industrial belt continued to draw upon the country
districts of the East, which, with the continued migration
to the West, greatly impoverished the rural
life and resulted in many abandoned farms. In the
city housing conditions of the poor were worse if
anything than they had been thirty years before.
Crowded tenements, filthy streets, flies, and vermin
abounded. Under the English common law accidents
in the mills were matters of concern only to the
employees, and the human toll of the railways was
enormous. Years of toil, a worn-out frame, a dependent
old age, and finally the potter's field was the
weary round of life to the millions of dependent
people who swarmed about the industrial centers.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of outside criticism and the
influence of religion, the lot of the slave was mending,
though there was room enough for improvement.
From sun to sun was always the plantation day, and
the weekly ration was a peck of meal and four pounds
of meat&mdash;salted &ldquo;side meat&rdquo; packed in Cincinnati or
Chicago. Each negro family had a single-room cabin,
where man, wife, and a dozen children were tucked
away in the loft or slept on the floor, though there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>

was usually a bed for the parents. There was, however,
always plenty of fresh air, a big open fireplace,
and generally shade trees about the negro quarters,
which conditions probably account for the lower mortality
rate in the South than in the East. Of clothing
the slave had only what was absolutely necessary,
children being limited to a single garment which
reached slightly below the knees. Against accidents
and disease more precautions were taken by masters
of plantations than by masters of mills, for the life
of a negro man or child-bearing woman was equal to
twelve hundred dollars. Heavy ditching in malarial
swamps was therefore done by Irishmen, whose lives
were less important to the planter. Physicians were
promptly called for the slaves, and women in labor
were generally cared for, because a negro baby was
worth one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>If there was some public concern for the slaves in
the fields and some beginnings of legislation on the
conditions of employment in the industrial States,
there was no thought for the isolated, lean, heavy-fisted
farmer of the Southern up-country or the
Western prairies. Land was still cheap, crops were
increasing in bulk and value every year. Nor did the
farmer desire the attentions of society, provided the
new railroads were laid through his districts and rates
were not too exorbitant. He worked hard for a few
months, then rested till harvest time, after which he
hunted and fished. During the long cold winters of
the Northwest he sat in his chimney corner or tended
his cattle. Few thought of fertilizing their land; terracing
against rains and floods was almost unknown,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and for most farmers plowing was done up and down
the hills, which only hastened the washing-away process
so characteristic of the Southern agriculture.
Very few farmers thought it worth while to rotate
their crops when fresh lands were to be had at a few
dollars an acre. The area of the United States seemed
limitless, and hardly a tenth of its arable land had
ever been brought under cultivation. The inventions
of 1840-50 enabled the Western farmer to grow
larger crops, and harvest time was not so burdensome;
corn-shellers and grain-fans shortened the
hours of labor for the men. Sewing-machines and
the revolving churns from the factories gave some
relief to the women, whose round of labor, milking,
cooking, cleaning, washing, and attending children,
was still almost ceaseless. Even the picnics and barbecues
offered little to them, for they must still prepare
the great baskets of food and serve their lords
and masters while they deliberated on &ldquo;bleeding
Kansas,&rdquo; new railroad schemes, or negro slavery.</p>

<p>Whether the lot of the landless and the less talented
had improved since the day of Jackson would
be hard to determine. If it was easier to purchase
land, or if there was an actual increase in wages, the
number of the poorer class of Americans had increased
both actually and relatively, and thus competition
operated to prevent improved housing and
a better country life. Still the life of the great majority
in the United States was less grinding than
that of Europeans of the same class, and the opportunity
for a poor man to rise in the social and economic
scale was distinctly better. That is what made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
America the Mecca of so many thousands during the
decade of 1850-60. Yet illiteracy and dependency,
causes and results of poverty, were almost appalling.
Georgia had a population of 43,684 white illiterates,
to say nothing of the 500,000 blacks; Massachusetts
had 46,262; Indiana, 60,943; Pennsylvania, 72,156,
and North Carolina, 68,128. There were 101 persons
in the jails of Georgia on June 1, 1860; Virginia
had 189; Massachusetts, 1161, and Illinois,
485. In the open life of the South and West, where
men could easily get to the land, there was little
crime and jails were often empty; in the industrial
belt the prisons were always occupied. In like manner
and for the same reasons Southern and Western
hospitals for the insane and homes for the poor often
showed very small percentages of these unfortunates.
Perhaps the unrelieved poverty of the industrial
workers and the stress of uncertainty in the matter
of employment made the differences. Certainly the
weight of the old English common law system, adopted
in all the States, bore hardly on the dependent
classes of the East; and the courts were not loath to
send undefended men to prison. In the South the
worker was punished by his master on the plantation
for all the minor offenses, and it was only free negroes
and the poorer whites who were the subjects of
the ordinary social discipline and punishment.</p>

<p>The abounding wealth and strenuous zest of American
life were creating just those gradations in society
and distinctions of caste against which constitutions
and laws inveighed. On the broad basis of
African slavery the enterprising Southerner had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
built and was now perfecting a social class hardly
inferior to the aristocracies of Europe. Soft hands
and exclusive manners were there as elsewhere in the
world the evidences of a gentle life; sturdy personal
independence and rough ways, here as in England,
were the marks of middle-class training, through
which recruits to the privileged order had generally
come. Openly and on all proper occasions the Southerners
announced the break-down of democracy and
the benefits of a cultured &eacute;lite; the few thousand
&ldquo;first families,&rdquo; who lived upon the incomes of plantations,
spent their winters in New Orleans, their
springs in Charleston, and their summers at the Virginia
springs. Among these, tutors were engaged to
train children, and every man had his valet, every
lady her maid. Travel in Europe, sojourns at Newport
and Saratoga, and acquaintance with the best
hotels of Philadelphia and New York were common
to this group of most attractive people. When Congress
was in session, they dominated the social life
of the capital, gave elaborate balls, and brought
effective pressure to bear upon aspiring Eastern and
Western public leaders. Douglas had married a beautiful
North Carolina heiress, the wife of Jefferson
Davis was the granddaughter of a governor of New
Jersey, and even William H. Seward was strongly
influenced by the graces of his planter friends. Senators,
representatives, and judges of the federal courts
owned estates in the lower South which yielded incomes
ofttimes greater than their official salaries.
The very flower and beauty of the land were Southern
gentlemen like Robert E. Lee and Wade Hamp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>ton,
or ladies like the sprightly Mrs. Chestnut or the
genial Mrs. Pryor.</p>

<p>Nor did the commercial and industrial life of the
East fail to produce a similar fruit. If the Eastern
gentleman were less dependent on his valet and less
averse to work with his hands, he was nevertheless
a gentleman, and the chasm between him and the
toiler in the mills was difficult to bridge. There was
nowhere in the United States a more exclusive society
than that in which the Danas and the Winthrops
of Boston moved. And the New England &eacute;lite
were never so happy as when they could run off to
England and frequent the dinners and receptions of
the British aristocracy; both the manners and the
ideals of the Eastern upper class resembled strikingly
those of the &ldquo;best people&rdquo; of Old England. It was
all in striking contrast to the ideals of the Puritans
of old times, but it was natural. In New England, as
in the South, democracy was flouted and a privileged
position greatly prized. The old American &ldquo;equality&rdquo;

was only skin deep, as any one would have recognized
if he had attempted familiarities with either
the Eastern or the Southern social leaders. The difference
was that the one group lived in cities when
they were at home, and the other in the country.</p>

<p>Nor was this American social life scorned by European
noblemen. Charles Sumner was always welcome
in the greatest houses of London, and the
Slidells and the Masons of the South received no
less flattering attentions from their European economic
and social kinsmen. One of Bismarck's most
intimate friends was John L. Motley, and the friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>ship
had been contracted long before Motley had
won fame as a historian. American heiresses had
already found suitors among the British nobility.
The kinship of Eastern social life with that of Europe
was recognized, and the relations of the well-to-do at
the North with the wealthy of the South were many
and intimate. Thus in America as elsewhere talent,
birth, and money produced social strata, and before
1860 the distinctions of class were only less sharply
drawn here than in the older countries of the world.</p>

<p>But, next to the very necessaries of life, religion
was the most important subject to Americans of 1860.
The Puritan spirit, while losing some of its hold in
New England, had captured the people of the rest
of the country. Except as to the Catholics and the
Episcopalians, all Americans were born, or thought
themselves born, utterly depraved and weighted down
with the sin of Adam and Eve, their &ldquo;first parents,&rdquo;
from which burden the only way of escape was through
prayer and agony of soul. Even this prospect was
denied to many, for some influential religious teachers
urged that God could not hear the supplications
of sinners. These must await the call of Heaven,
and if this failed, they were bound for the &ldquo;lake of
fire,&rdquo; whence there was no return. The intelligent
and well-informed spoke with all seriousness of &ldquo;getting
religion,&rdquo; and in the vast country districts the
most suitable season for this was the hot July and
August days. Revivals among nearly all the leading
denominations were held at this time in the churches
or under widespread arbors made from the branches
of trees. The preaching and the singing were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

unlike that which brought the Germans of the eighth
century to the Roman communion. The other worlds
were just two: one the city of the golden gates and
pearly streets, the other the bottomless pit of liquid
fire into which Satan would surely plunge all who
failed to make their peace with God in this life. The
old Puritan lines formerly learned by every child&mdash;</p>

<pre>
         "God's vengeance feeds the flame
          With piles of wood and brimstone flood,
          That none can quench the same"&mdash;
</pre>

<p>represented to most people of the decade just preceding
the Civil War all they said. Both old men and
young children dreamed of the awful retribution
which awaited them in the other world.</p>

<p>And there was a fiery zeal in the work of saving
men's souls from the wrath to come which showed
that it was no figurative faith which moved the preachers
and their co-workers. A song sung by all ran
in one of its favorite stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        &ldquo;Must I be carried to the skies
          On flow'ry beds of ease,
         While others fought to win the prize
          And sailed through bloody seas?&rdquo;

</pre>

<p>Excitement naturally overcame many, and they rushed
forward to the mourner's benches in front of the altar
and cried out for mercy, or silently prayed for days
and weeks till the light &ldquo;broke upon them&rdquo; and they
went forth shouting for joy. These then became exhorters,
and moved among their friends in the congregation,
begging them to yield their &ldquo;proud and
haughty spirits&rdquo; ere it should be too late. At times
scores of penitents would be on their knees in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
spaces about the altar, others would be &ldquo;laboring&rdquo;
with the sinners not yet stricken, and still others
thanking God in loud voices for their delivery from
sin and Satan, whom all regarded as an active demon
always seeking whom he might destroy.</p>

<p>In the South the deism which had influenced the
generation led by Washington and Jefferson had given
way to the stern faith of the Calvinists, for whether
one were Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, or Campbellite,
the essentials of his religion were the same.
Wealthy planters, small farmers, and negro slaves
sought the salvation of their souls in the same
churches and under the same preachers. In fact it
was common for men to be told by their pastors that
unless they were willing to sit down in heaven by
the side of the &ldquo;poor slave&rdquo; they could not be saved,
and the slave often begged his master to accept the
terms of salvation. A few great planters who were not
touched by the religious fervor of the time held aloof,
and the poorer whites and the slaves came to accept
the view that these were the rich men who could not
be saved, and commonly said hell was their unavoidable
portion.</p>

<p>In the East, save in the Unitarian and Episcopalian
churches, there was the same religious realism.
In the great revivals of 1857 earnest men and great
congregations prayed aloud that God might convert
the heretical Theodore Parker, or that, if he were
not a subject of grace, as many believed he was not,
he might be taken from this world, where he was
doing infinite mischief. Of course he was to be consigned
immediately to the &ldquo;fiery furnace below.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
And the greatest of American preachers, Henry
Ward Beecher, in the same revival, gathered about
him the hard-headed business men of New York City
and together they prayed that wicked playwrights
and worldly-minded theater-goers might be brought
to a realizing sense of the shame of their conduct,
and that the houses of their frivolous vice might be
converted into temples of Christian worship. Again,
those who would not heed the solemn warnings of
the pulpit were &ldquo;given up,&rdquo; and the Heavenly Father
was asked to remove them &ldquo;hence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The influence of this sense of the awfulness of the
after life to those who might not be saved was far-reaching.
The farmer, driven by the hard necessity
of making a living for himself and family to remain
away from church, meditated sorrowfully as he followed
his plow, and often at the end of his furrow
fell upon his knees and besought the Creator to save
his undying soul and spare him the everlasting torture
of the damned. A popular little gift book, published
by the American Tract Society of New York,
was entitled <i>Passing Over Jordan</i>, and on an early
page we find the following typical lines:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
          &ldquo;My thoughts on awful subjects roll,
            Damnation and the dead:
           What horrors seize my guilty soul
            Upon a dying bed.&rdquo;
</pre>

<p>And a young woman who received this as a New
Year's present was a perfectly normal girl of Cincinnati
and the daughter of a prominent family there.</p>

<p>What was happening in the United States during
the thirty years we are studying was the saving of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>

the people from the rough and often coarse and sensual
life of the frontier. Under conditions such as
have been described the influence and power of the
preacher in young America were extraordinary. And
the clergy deserved the authority they exercised.
Never before the war was a Methodist bishop even
charged with immoral conduct. The standards of the
Baptists and Presbyterians were equally high. The
preachers who called men to repentance were beyond
question of the highest character. Earnest, sincere,
overwhelmed with the sense of their responsibility,
they &ldquo;preached the Word with power,&rdquo; and the Word
was the Bible which all believed implicitly from cover
to cover. It was not clear to preacher or congregation
how God spoke to man first in the Hebrew of
the Old Testament, then in the Greek of the New
Testament, and finally in the Authorized Version of
James I. But it mattered not; the Bible was inspired
by the Heavenly Father, for it was so stated
in Revelation, and a curse was held up for him who
denied its truth or so much as removed one syllable
or added a line. It was the authority of the Bible as
preached by Martin Luther and John Calvin, and the
interpreters of the Sacred Book were the clergy, not
the Pope or some distant sacerdotal see.</p>

<p>Just how many people were members of the
churches it would be very difficult accurately to determine.
The Methodists of the South numbered
nearly a million in 1860, those of the North were
equally strong. The Baptists, North, South, and
West, were nearly as numerous. The Presbyterians,
Congregationalists, and Christians (Campbellites)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
had each some hundreds of thousands of members.
All the churches, including Catholics, offered seating
accommodations for about 20,000,000 of the
31,000,000 people of the country; which is a large
proportion. And from the census returns, it seems
that church accommodations were always best and
most plentiful in the older communities, the East
having almost as many pews as there were people.
The South could seat 6,500,000 worshipers,&mdash;that is,
a little more than half of the population; the Northwest
was able to accommodate only about 4,000,000.</p>

<p>With Protestant churches so powerful and their
ministers so influential, it is only natural that the
religious teachings of the time should have told in
politics and the sectional struggle. The Southerners
believed almost implicitly in the claim of their great
Presbyterian preacher, B. M. Palmer, when he declared
in 1860: &ldquo;In this great struggle, we defend
the cause of God and religion; it is our solemn duty
to ourselves, to our slaves, to the world, and to Almighty
God to preserve and transmit our existing
system of domestic servitude, with the right, unchallenged
by man, to go and root itself wherever Providence
and Nature may carry it.&rdquo; Methodists, Baptists,
Catholics, and all other important bodies of
Christians in the South held and taught the same
doctrine. In the Northwest there was some hesitation
about going so far, but the majority undoubtedly
believed with Dr. Nathan L. Rice, of Chicago, that
slavery was divinely established and not to be disturbed
by man. In the East some of the Unitarians
taught abolition and supported Garrison and Phillips;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>

more of the Congregationalists were of the same
mind. But in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia
the greater clergy had come to regret the former
tendency to denounce slavery, and they were inclined
to preach the doctrine that Providence had established
slavery and that it should be left to Providence
to remove it in due time. Only in the rural
districts of the East, where the old New England
spirit still flourished, was slavery declared to be &ldquo;the
awful curse.&rdquo; And here it was that the old sectional
hatred was strongest. The churches and the clergy
with all their influence had thus given up the problem
of slavery, and their counsel and advice were to
maintain the Union and to put down all sectional
conflict. Nationalism with the South dominant was
the meaning of this; nor do the election returns of
1852 and 1856 make a different showing.</p>

<p>Where religious influences were so potent, it was
natural that the clergy should exert themselves for
the education of the young. Yale College was a
&ldquo;school of the prophets&rdquo; which sent out to the West
the young preachers and teachers so much needed if
Congregationalism was to hold its own in that region.
Princeton was Presbyterian headquarters for both
West and South, and few institutions have ever exerted
a greater civilizing force in a new nation than
that school of sternest theology. Dr. Charles Hodge
was there a tower of orthodox and conservative
strength which could be seen from afar. In numerous
other institutions the Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists,
Friends, and Campbellites trained
their ministers and urged upon all the importance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
education. At the University of Virginia there were
chaplains maintained by the different denominations
for the religious instruction of the students. The
Methodists of Michigan regularly appointed a professor
to the state university for the same purpose.
Other state universities, like those of Indiana and
North Carolina, were brought under practical denominational
control through the zealous activity of
Presbyterian presidents.</p>

<p>The education of the little children was, however,
too much for the most zealous of religious organizations.
Jefferson had set in motion influences which
had greatly strengthened the cause of popular education
in the South and West. But nowhere did the
States prepare fully for the work. In the Northwest
the public school lands were wasted by thoughtless or
venal politicians, and in the older South the label,
&ldquo;school for the children of the poor,&rdquo; went far to
defeat all efforts made by legislatures on behalf of
good public school systems. In the period of 1840-50
Horace Mann revived the New England interest in
education and laid the foundations for the school systems
of to-day. Even so ardent a Southerner as William
L. Yancey, of Alabama, became a disciple of the
New England reformer, and tried to do a similar
work in his State. In Indiana, Illinois, and the other
Western States educational reforms followed. There
were in consequence about 5,000,000 children in
school in the year 1860. Of these the South had
796,000, the Northwest, exclusive of California,
2,005,196, and the East, 2,011,826; which shows that
Southern public opinion had not yet been aroused to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>

the importance of the subject. But the figures for
illiteracy, already given, do not show a worse condition
among the whites of the South than is shown
in the Northwestern States.</p>

<p>If the returns for college education be taken, the
balance among the sections is fairly re&euml;stablished.
There were 25,882 college students in the South in
1860, and this does not take into account the large
number of Southern students in Eastern institutions
like Princeton and Harvard. There were at the same
time 16,959 college students in the Northwest, and
10,449 in the East.</p>

<p>Between education and the attainments of science
and invention there is some connection, though genius
often defies all conventional methods of instruction.
In addition to the epoch-making inventions of
McCormick and his competitors, Samuel F. B. Morse
had perfected his electric telegraph, which was in
operation in most of the countries of Europe before
1860. Richard M. Hoe revolutionized newspaper
publishing in the late forties by his rotary printing-press,
which put out thousands of copies of a paper
in an hour. Nor was Elias Howe's sewing-machine
any less of a wonder when it came into use about
1850. Draper and Morse's new photography, Thurber's
typewriter, Woodruff's sleeping-car, and many
other marvelous contrivances of the same period
showed the fertility of the American inventive genius.</p>

<p>In scientific research the United States could not
present so many evidences of her success, though in
1860 Alexander Dallas Bache, the head of the Coast
Survey, was counted one of the leading scientists of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
his time, and Louis Agassiz, the Swiss-American
naturalist, was teaching now in Charleston, now in
the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard, and beginning
the great work, <i>Contributions to the Natural
History of the United States</i>, which his son, Alexander,
was to complete. Joseph Henry, the first head
of the Smithsonian Institution, was equally well
known, and he and Professor Bache were the backbones
of the American National Academy of Science,
just beginning its beneficent work. Silliman, of Yale,
and Mitchell, of the University of North Carolina,
were the best-known geologists.</p>

<p>Nor was art degenerating in this period of great
prosperity. Hiram Powers, of Cincinnati, the ablest
sculptor of his country, was greatly hurt because
Congress refused him the contract for the decorative
work on the magnificent Capitol in Washington, at
last nearing completion. His aspirations were not
unreasonable, for his Greek Slave, a beautiful work
in marble, had captured the imagination of both
American and foreign critics in 1851. Still, Thomas
Crawford, his successful competitor, was a sculptor
of real gifts, as one may see in his statues of Jefferson
and Patrick Henry in Richmond. The work of
Allston, Sully, and De Veaux, the painters, was being
improved upon by Chester Harding, Eastman Johnson,
and William Morris Hunt, all influenced, however,
by Turner of England, the D&uuml;sseldorf (Germany)
and Barbizon (France) schools. There were now
many wealthy business men in the country, and thus
artists had a fair chance of a livelihood while their
ideals and technique were developing. In Boston,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
New York, and Philadelphia were the beginnings of
the museums which were a few years later to become
schools of art of no mean importance.</p>

<p>But the flower of American culture was its literature.
To be sure Edgar Allan Poe, whose <i>Raven</i> and
short stories were ere long to give him the first rank
among all American men of letters, had been suffered
to starve in the midst of New York's millions in 1849,
and Hawthorne found it very difficult to find the
means of a meager livelihood in Massachusetts. If
the <i>Raven</i> and the <i>Scarlet Letter</i> were born unwelcome,
Ralph Waldo Emerson was making a living
as author and sage of his generation, and there were
others of the Transcendentalists&mdash;Thoreau, the
woodland poet, Margaret Fuller, the woman knight-errant,
recently drowned at sea, and Amos Bronson
Alcott&mdash;whose writings appeared in standard editions
and who lived by their pens. Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, a professor at Harvard till 1854, though
savagely criticized by Poe and Margaret Fuller, had
won the American heart in his <i>Village Blacksmith</i>

and <i>Evangeline</i>. He scored his greatest triumph in
<i>Miles Standish</i> in 1858. And another Harvard
professor, Oliver Wendell Holmes, was just coming
into a national reputation in 1860 by his <i>Autocrat
of the Breakfast Table</i> and other similar writings.</p>

<p>A more radical poet was John Greenleaf Whittier,
contributor to the <i>National Era</i>, a radical anti-slavery
journal which first gave publicity to Mrs. Harriet
Beecher Stowe's famous <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. Whittier's
<i>Ichabod</i>, which appeared in 1850, and is already
quoted in these pages, gave its author a devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>

following among the radicals and hastened Webster
to his grave. Mrs. Stowe's work was perhaps the
most influential book ever written by an American,
though it hardly ranks as literature. Of a similarly
intense nature was James Russell Lowell, whose <i>Biglow
Papers</i> of 1846 to 1857 unmercifully lampooned
the party which waged the war on Mexico and ridiculed
the leaders of the South and West. Succeeding
Longfellow at Harvard, Lowell helped to establish
in 1857 the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, which still
remains the best of American magazines.</p>

<p>There was nowhere else in the country such a
school of literary men as this of New England,
though in Charleston William Gilmore Simms was
still publishing historical novels, espousing the cause
of Southern literature in <i>Russell's Magazine</i>, and
stimulating the ambitions of young men. One of his
pupils, Henry Timrod, whose <i>At Magnolia Cemetery</i>
is likely to prove immortal, was worthy to be compared
with Poe; and another, Paul Hamilton Hayne,
certainly deserved a higher rank and a better fortune
than either of these struggling poets has been
accorded. But perhaps the most original writings of
the time were those of a certain group of obscure
men in Georgia and the lower South. A. B. Longstreet,
the author of <i>Georgia Scenes</i>, William Tappan
Thompson, of <i>Major Jones's Courtship</i>, and
Joseph B. Baldwin, of <i>Flush Times in Alabama and
Mississippi</i>, struck a rich vein of ludicrous humor
which Mark Twain worked out after the war.</p>

<p>In Richmond the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>
was still the clearing-house for Southern writers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
<i>De Bow's Review</i> was eminent in the field of social
and economic studies. New York City had, however,
become the Mecca of the men who had manuscripts
to submit. There the Harper Brothers published
their <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, which went to 150,000
subscribers, we are told, each month, and the <i>Knickerbocker
Magazine</i>, distinguished by the contributions
of Washington Irving, the Nestor of American
writers, tried to keep pace. Both the Harpers and
the Putnams did an enormous business in books of
all kinds, now that so many Americans had grown
rich. Walter Scott's novels were imported for the
South in carload lots, while Dickens's numberless
volumes found ready sale in the East, thus showing
the different tastes of the sections.</p>

<p>And the historians had increased their vogue with
a people just beginning to realize that they had ancestors
and taking a becoming pride in their early
history. Bancroft's <i>History of the United States</i>

was sold in all sections in a way that would astound
present-day historians. Richard Hildreth, a sturdy
partisan, added his six volumes to Bancroft's in
1849-54 by way of antidote; and George Tucker,
of the University of Virginia, still further &ldquo;corrected&rdquo;
the history of his country, the better to suit
the tastes of Southerners. John L. Motley published
his <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i> in 1856 at his own
expense, and suddenly found himself one of the
foremost historians of his time, his work being
quickly translated into all the important languages
of Europe. William H. Prescott, an older man and
a greater historian, already well known for his <i>Reign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, gave to the printer his
<i>Reign of Philip II</i> in 1855-58, and easily maintained
his supremacy in the field of history.</p>

<p>It was an aspiring generation that produced Poe,
Hawthorne, Lowell, and the rest, and if one considers
the character of American culture, its lack of
unity, and the still youthful nature of its people, it
is easy to understand the pride in its budding art
and maturer literature, the sensitiveness to foreign
criticism, the provincialism which demands attention
and a &ldquo;place in the sun.&rdquo; Carlyle's scorn and Macaulay's
contempt were indeed as irritating as they
were unjust, for America had gone a long way since
the rough backwoodsman, Andrew Jackson, came to
the Presidency by almost unanimous consent in 1829.</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>James Ford Rhodes in his <i>History of the United States</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">I</span>,
chap. <span class="smcap">IV</span>, gives an account of social conditions in the South just prior
to the war and, in vol. <span class="smcap">III</span>, chap. <span class="smcap">XII</span>, there is a similar picture of conditions
in the North. McMaster's last volume describes the life
of the people for this period. But I have found most valuable information
in works of travel like F. L. Olmsted's <i>A Journey in the
Seaboard Slave States</i> (1856) and <i>A Journey Through the Back
Country</i> (1863), W. H. Russell's <i>My Diary North and South</i> (1863),
Sir Charles Lyell's <i>A Second Visit to the United States</i> (1849),
Peter Cartwright's <i>Autobiography</i> (1856), and James Dixon's

<i>Personal Narrative</i> (1849); and in John Weiss's <i>Life and Correspondence
of Theodore Parker</i> (1864); Beecher and Scoville's <i>Biography
of Henry Ward Beecher</i> (1888); W. E. Hatcher's <i>Life of J. B.
Jeter</i> (1887); T. C. Johnson's <i>The Life and Letters of Benjamin
Morgan Palmer</i> (1906); and the valuable <i>American Church History</i>

series (1893-97). On American sculpture Lorado Taft's <i>American
Sculpture</i> (1903), and Charles H. Caffin's <i>American Masters of
Sculpture</i> (1903), are useful and discriminating. Caffin has also
written <i>The Story of American Painting</i> (1907), which is perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the best short account of the subject. For a good view of the literary
and publishing interests of 1860, W. P. Trent's <i>A History of
American Literature</i> (1903) is most valuable, and W. B. Cairns's
<i>A History of American Literature</i> (1912) is likewise important.
George H. Putnam's <i>George Palmer Putnam: A Memoir</i> (1912) and
J. H. Harper's <i>The House of Harper</i> (1912) give important information
about the rise of the publishing houses. Of course <i>De
Bow's Review</i>, <i>Resources of the South and West</i>, and the <i>Reports
of the Census</i> for 1850 and 1860 are indispensable.</p>

<h4>STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS</h4>

<p>If the two preceding chapters have shown that the
larger social and economic interests tended strongly
toward the elimination of sectional hostility, political
conditions and party vows gave even stronger assurances
that there should be no more conflicts like those
of 1833 and 1850. Yet there was one section of the
country which was a sort of storm center, the Northwest.
There a wide expanse of rich lands held by
Indians, a rapidly increasing population, and great
annual harvests of wheat and corn, selling at high
prices, created a condition not unlike that of the
lower South when Jackson became President. Removal
of the Indians from the fertile areas of the
Nebraska country, the creation of new Territories,
and the building of railroads connecting the wheat
and corn areas with Chicago and the Eastern markets
were the demands of the Northwest in 1853, and a
really great party leader would have seen the problem
and his duty.</p>

<p>But Pierce was not a great leader. In the make-up
of his Cabinet he chose William L. Marcy, of
New York, for Secretary of State, James Campbell,
of Pennsylvania, for Postmaster-General, and Caleb
Cushing, of Massachusetts, for Attorney-General,
all of whom were close political allies of the South.
Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, became Secretary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>

War, and James C. Dobbin, of North Carolina, Secretary
of the Navy. Both of these were extreme pro-slavery
men. From the West, James Guthrie, of
Kentucky, and Robert McClelland, of Michigan,
were taken into the President's Council, the one to
be Secretary of the Treasury and the other the head
of the Department of the Interior. Although Douglas
had been the strongest candidate for the nomination
for the Presidency before the recent Democratic
Convention, neither he nor any of his friends was
selected. Nor did it seem wise to those who were
then shaping the destinies of the country to conciliate
the still powerful anti-slavery element of the
East.</p>

<p>Looking backwards the new Administration found
three lines of procedure open to it, all suggested by
President Polk in his later messages to Congress.
One of these was the closer attachment of California
to the rest of the country, another was the purchase
of Cuba as a makeweight to the growing Northwest,
and the third was the rapid expansion of American
commerce by federal subsidies to shipping and the
opening of new channels of trade.</p>

<p>To carry into effect the first of these, James
Gadsden, an able railroad president of South Carolina,
was sent to Mexico to purchase a large strip of
land lying along the southern border of New Mexico
and thus make easy the building of a national railway
from Memphis to San Francisco, for the lowest
passes over the Rocky Mountains were in this region.
Gadsden returned in the autumn successful. For
$10,000,000 he had secured 50,000 square miles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
territory, and the way was open for the Government
to lay its plans for the greatest undertaking ever
proposed by the most latitudinarian politicians.
Davis, hitherto an extreme States-rights leader and
disciple of Calhoun, worked out the program. The
constitutional authority for building a Pacific railroad
was deduced from the &ldquo;war powers&rdquo; of the Federal
Government, and, though it was not definitely stated
that the road should pass through the recent annexation,
it was commonly understood that such was the
purpose of the President and that the lower South
was to be the economic and social beneficiary of the
great improvement. Arkansas, Texas, and California
were willing and anxious to build the parts of the
road that passed through their territory. With the
exception of a group of Gulf-city representatives and
some of the up-country Democrats of the older South,
the leaders of the party approved the plan, and Pierce
made the Pacific railroad the burden of his first annual
message to Congress. Congress voted the money
for the preliminary survey of five routes to the Pacific,
and confided the work to Jefferson Davis, the recognized
leader of the Administration. The people of
the country, long familiar with the arguments of
Asa Whitney and others in favor of such an undertaking,
made no objection, though men of political
foresight saw the far-reaching purposes of the scheme.</p>

<p>To effect the second object of the Democratic
program, the purchase of Cuba, Pierre Soul&eacute;, of
Louisiana, was sent to Spain. Soul&eacute; was one of the
most ardent of Southern expansionists, and his mission
was not relished at Madrid any more than it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>

was approved by conservative Eastern Democrats.
In support of the new Spanish Minister, John Y.
Mason, of Virginia, and James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania,
both former members of the Polk Cabinet,
were sent as Ministers to France and England respectively.
Soul&eacute; made little progress till the Black
Warrior, an American coasting vessel, was seized in
1854 by the Spanish authorities in Havana and
searched in the expectation of finding evidence that
the people of the United States were still assisting
the Cuban insurrectionists. No proof was discovered,
and the people of the country, especially those of the
South, were greatly excited; for a time it seemed that
war would ensue. Davis and Soul&eacute; pressed the case
upon the President, at the risk of war and perhaps
in the hope that war would follow and that thus
Cuba, so long coveted, would fall into the lap of the
United States. But Marcy, though ambitious of annexing
Cuba, was hard pressed by Eastern public
opinion, and he persuaded Pierce to recall his hasty
minister. This was not done, however, until the three
ministers concerned had met at Ostend in the autumn
of 1855 and published to the world the manifesto
which declared it to be the purpose of their Government
not to allow any other European country to get
possession of Cuba, and which further stated that the
United States was always ready to pay a fair price
for the island. A more moderate man succeeded
Soul&eacute;, but the subject was pressed at Madrid with
increasing persistence during the remainder of that
and the next Administration.</p>

<p>The third item of the Democratic policy, the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>pansion
of American commerce, was furthered by a
continuation of the subsidies to steamship companies
like the Collins line, which put upon the ocean many
vessels of the best and largest build. Even more was
planned in offering Robert J. Walker the mission
to China, and the appointment of Townsend Harris,
a wealthy New York merchant, as consul to Ningpo,
Japan. Walker declined, but Harris accepted, and
within two years, with the assistance of Commodore
Perry, he succeeded in opening the hermit kingdom
to the civilization and commerce of the United States.
It was the beginning of modern Japan, and it marked
a new stage in the development of American trade
in the Orient. In all these measures Pierce met with
some opposition in the East, particularly in the rough
handling of the Cuban question; and there was much
dislike of the Southern filibustering against Lower
California and, especially at the close of the Administration,
against Nicaragua, which was seized by
William Walker, the Tennessee imperialist already
mentioned, and proclaimed in 1856 a slave State.
But the opposition was rather to the spirit and tone
of things, and the very plain subserviency of the
President to Southern wishes, than against expansion
as such. The real resistance to Pierce came on another
matter and in the most unexpected way, in the
struggle over the Kansas-Nebraska Bill.</p>

<p>The stone rejected of the builders really became the
head of the corner, for in spite of all that the Pierce
Administration could do, the problem of the Northwest,
which Douglas personified, became the bone of
contention between the sections, and again, as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
1850, the South, the East, and the Northwest struggled
for supremacy. When the Davis plans for a
southern Pacific railroad were maturing, Senator
Douglas, the head of the Senate Committee on Territories,
was preparing to renew his six-year fight for
the opening of the wide Nebraska hinterland of his
section. The squatters of the Kansas and the Platte
River Valleys were already confronted with hostile
Indians who protested against the unlawful seizure
of their lands. And now that wheat and corn were
becoming great staple crops, the Northwestern pioneers
were loudly demanding that the natives should
not be permitted to cumber the ground. They must
move on to the arid desert beyond or be carried into
the Southern country, which Davis, as we have seen,
was trying to open to Southern pioneers. It was a real
conflict of interest between the lower South and the
Northwest, and in order to win, the Northwestern
politicians must find allies in the East as Clay had
done in 1825-36, though Douglas as an &ldquo;old-line&rdquo;

Democrat could not so readily see this.</p>

<p>He resorted to management and <i>finesse</i>. He found
two delegates from Nebraska in Washington in December,
1853, one from what was soon to be Kansas,
the other from the pioneers of Nebraska. It was
natural, therefore, for him to change his Nebraska
bill of the former sessions into a bill for the creation
of two Territories, with the two rival delegates as
their prospective spokesmen in Congress. Besides,
Douglas, who was a consummate politician, would
have two more loyal followers and two other embryo
States in his wing of the Democratic party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence Douglas prepared for the removal of the
Indians, for the creation of two Territories instead
of one, and he enlisted in his cause the Senators and
Representatives of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin,
by showing them that their own schemes for
the granting of public lands to assist in the building
of railroads would be furthered by their voting for
the opening of Nebraska. Every economic and political
instinct of the people of the Northwest tended
to enlist them in the cause of Douglas and Nebraska.
And it was known to most of the Chicago public and
big business men that a Pacific railroad was to be
laid from Council Bluffs, a point already in railroad
connection with Chicago, to San Francisco, in the
event of the rapid development of the Platte River
country. But St. Louis and Missouri leaders would
oppose this because they had been fighting since 1848
to get a railway to the Pacific directly from Kansas
City.</p>

<p>There was, however, a vigorous pro-slavery party
in Missouri, led by David Atchison. This party had
overthrown Benton, and their first purpose was the
making of Kansas a slave State. It was the western
half of Missouri which now controlled the State, and
the commercial element of St. Louis, to which the
Pacific railroad was so attractive, was in the minority.
Douglas won Atchison and western Missouri to
his plans by holding out to them that their contention,
as old as Missouri itself, that the Compromise
of 1820 was unconstitutional, might be granted by
Congress. When this was fully appreciated, Kentucky
and Tennessee leaders became interested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Southern newspapers took up the discussion and
Douglas immediately became a statesman. Even Jefferson
Davis was led to commit himself to the new
Kansas-Nebraska Bill when the anti-slavery men of
the East began to attack it. And on Sunday, January
22, Pierce promised Douglas the official support
of the Administration.</p>

<p>The bill now provided for two Territories west of
the Missouri River, for the formal repeal of the Missouri
Compromise, and for the adoption of the old
Cass doctrine of popular sovereignty, whereby the
settlers in the new communities were to determine
for themselves whether they would have slaves or not.
If any dispute arose as to this a test was to be made
of the question in the United States courts. This
looked like a surrender of a large part of the public
domain to the South, and the repeal of the semi-sacred
Compromise was perhaps the boldest proposition
that had ever been offered in Congress. Still
the great purpose was the development of the Northwest,
and wise public men might have seen that the
populous free States of the Northwest would inevitably
win and make the 400,000 square miles of
Nebraska free territory; and if the railroad bills
which Douglas supported and tied to his main measure
by all kinds of promises passed, the supremacy
of the Northwest would be certain.</p>

<p>But the weakness of popular government is the
fact that public men are seldom strong enough to
deny themselves the opportunity of an appeal to the
people on a side issue, if such appeal promises political
victory. The day that Douglas introduced his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
bill, there appeared in the New York papers, <i>The
Appeal of the Independent Democrats</i>, signed by
Senators Chase and Sumner and the Free-Soil members
of the House. It was an able protest against the
repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and a denunciation
of the &ldquo;unscrupulous politician&rdquo; who made this
surrender of national and free States rights in order
to secure for himself the coveted Presidency. The
essential purpose of the Douglas legislation, the rapid
upbuilding of the Northwest and the blocking of the
Davis plans for a Pacific railroad, were entirely overlooked.
A wave of excitement swept over the East
and the New England colonies of the Northwest.
Petitions poured into Congress, meetings were held
to denounce Douglas as a second Benedict Arnold,
and he was burned in effigy by thousands who never
took the trouble to read the Kansas-Nebraska Bill
or seriously contemplated its effects. In Congress
Chase, Sumner, Seward, and even moderates like
Edward Everett denounced the ambitious politician
from Illinois who had dared to &ldquo;sell the birthright
of the free States for a mess of pottage.&rdquo; It was a
revival of the sectional hatred, as well as of the fears
of the aggressive planters who had enticed Douglas
to go one step farther than he had intended.</p>

<p>Though the South had begun to fear the consequences
of popular sovereignty and to see that Douglas
was only making the more certain the power of
his group of States, its spokesmen felt compelled
to support him in a fight against abolitionists and
anti-slavery agitators. Alexander Stephens, an able
Whig leader of Georgia, and most other members of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
that party in the South, gave Douglas hearty support.
The struggle developed into a fight between
the East and the South. A great many of the followers
of Douglas were won away from the original
program when it seemed a mere question of slavery
extension, and the Democrats of the Northwest divided
sharply. After four months of angry debate
and unprecedented log-rolling the bill became law,
and the President promptly organized Kansas and
Nebraska as Territories. Members of Congress went
home after the adjournment to face their constituents,
and a most exciting campaign followed. In
Wisconsin and Michigan a new party was organized.
Its appeal was to the fundamental American doctrines
that all men are equal and that no great interests
should rule the country. It received immediate
support in the two States mentioned, and in all
the counties of the Northwest where the New England
influence was predominant, in northern Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois. Naturally the remnants of the
old party organizations, the Whigs and the Free-Soilers,
lent enthusiastic support.</p>

<p>Chase and Sumner had called into being a new
idealist movement resembling that which had overwhelmed
the Federalists in 1800, and a group of new
leaders, soon to become famous, emerged. In addition
to the well-known names already mentioned, there
now appeared the kindly, shrewd Abraham Lincoln,
of Kentucky and Illinois; J. W. Grimes arose in
Iowa to threaten a Democratic machine which had
never known defeat; Zachary Chandler, of Michigan,
was making ready the stroke which was to un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>horse
the great and popular Cass; and Benjamin F.
Wade, of Ohio, joined Chase and Giddings, thus
making up the trio which was to rule that State for
years to come. The young and vigorous Republican
party of the Northwest, guided by this company of
ambitious &ldquo;new&rdquo; politicians, readily effected the
union of East and Northwest which Adams and Clay
had long striven in vain to perfect. The work of
Chase, Seward, Lincoln, and Sumner of these years
paralleled that of Calhoun, Jackson, and Benton in
1828; and as a result the Democrats lost their hold
on the legislatures of nearly all the States above the
Ohio and the Missouri Rivers, and their overwhelming
majority in the Federal House of Representatives
disappeared as if overnight.</p>

<p>While the new Republican party, almost wholly
sectional in its origin and perhaps in its purposes,
was winning leadership in the country, the more conservative
Whigs of the East sought to affiliate with
a small organization of nativists who called themselves
Americans and whose slogan was &ldquo;America
for Americans.&rdquo; Foreigners should be barred from
citizenship and Catholics should be ostracized. In the
South most followers of Clay and in the East many
admirers of Webster avoided a complete surrender to
the Democrats by stopping in this halfway house.
The &ldquo;Know-Nothings,&rdquo; as the party was called in
derision of their failure to answer questions about
their platform, gained so many followers from the
dissatisfied elements of the older parties that in 1855
it seemed likely they would sweep the country. In
Virginia they made their most spectacular campaign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>

Henry A. Wise, a Whig who had gone into the Democratic
party with Stephens, was their greatest opponent,
and in the gubernatorial campaign of 1855 he
completely discomfited them; in Georgia they likewise
lost their contest. The South was accepting the
Democratic leadership and becoming solid, as Calhoun
had prayed that it might become. In the East,
Seward and Weed persuaded most of the Whigs to
unite with the Republicans, and when the first national
convention of the Americans met in 1856, it was
clear that its leaders could not hold the Southern and
Eastern wings together on the slavery question. The
anti-slavery Americans bolted, and the remnant
which remained nominated ex-President Fillmore,
who in the succeeding election received a majority in
only one State, Maryland, though his popular vote
was nearly a million. The parties of the future were
plainly the Democratic, Southern, pro-slavery, and
well organized, and the Republican, Northern, we
may now say, anti-slavery, and also well organized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the frontiersmen from Iowa and Missouri
were trying to work out the principle of popular
sovereignty in Kansas, and their Governor, Andrew
Reeder, was doing what he could to assist them.
Anti-slavery aid societies in the East sent resolute
men to Kansas to vote and save the Territory from
slavery, and pro-slavery lodges in Missouri went
across the border to vote against and perhaps to
shoot Free-State men who disputed the right of the
South to plant and to maintain slavery there. Under
these circumstances the first election for members
of the territorial legislature was a farce. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Reeder felt obliged to let the new assembly go on
with its work of making easy the immigration of masters
with their &ldquo;property&rdquo;; when he went East a little
later he took occasion to protest in a public address
against the intrusion of Missouri voters. He was regretfully
removed from office, though he returned
to Kansas to co&ouml;perate with Charles Robinson, a
Californian of political experience, in the organization
of the Free-State party, which refused to recognize
the territorial legislature and which met in voluntary
convention at Topeka in the autumn of 1855
and drew a state constitution. In this document
slavery was outlawed. Following the example of California,
representatives of the new government asked
for prompt admission to the Union.</p>

<p>The Southerners had never recognized California
as properly within the Union, and the pro-Southern
party in Kansas made open war upon the Topeka
party in December. Lawrence, the anti-slavery headquarters,
was besieged, but the new governor managed
to compromise so as to prevent bloodshed, and
the two governments of Kansas continued to exist.
The Federal Congress was compelled to decide which
of the questionable governments should be recognized
as lawful. Since the Senate was Democratic and pro-Southern,
and the House Republican and pro-Northern,
a decision was impossible. The Topeka constitution
was supported by the House, and even the fair
and reasonable bill of the Senate offered by Toombs
in 1856 was rejected. This called for a submission
of both parties in Kansas to an election safeguarded
against unlawful interference from any source. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
seemed that Seward, Chase, and their friends did
not desire a settlement before the election. And
Sumner's speech on the &ldquo;Crime of Kansas&rdquo; was a
challenge to war. He compared Douglas to &ldquo;the
noisome squat and nameless animal whose tongue
switched a perpetual stench,&rdquo; and Senator Butler, of
South Carolina, a leader of the highest character,
was a man who could not open his mouth but to lie.</p>

<p>The war of the sections was now renewed in the
most bitter form, as was shown when Preston Brooks,
a kinsman of Butler, assaulted Sumner a day or two
after the speech, resigned his seat in the House as
Representative from South Carolina, and was immediately
re&euml;lected. Sumner retired from the Senate,
a hero in all New England, and Massachusetts
ostentatiously refused to fill the vacant seat during
the next three years, thus constantly reminding her
people of Sumner's vituperation and the South Carolina
assault.</p>

<p>When the Democrats met in their national convention
in Cincinnati in June, the struggle in Kansas
still went on, and the excitement of the Sumner-Brooks
affair had not subsided. All elements of the
South were represented, and the American party
showed no signs of being able to carry a single
Southern State. The convention accepted Douglas's
popular sovereignty as its platform, but nominated
Buchanan as its candidate. He was &ldquo;available&rdquo; because
he had been out of the country for four years
and had said nothing on the Kansas quarrel. John
C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, was nominated for
the Vice-Presidency in the hope of winning Tennes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>see
and Kentucky, which had not voted for a Democratic
candidate since Jackson.</p>

<p>The Republicans used the &ldquo;Crime of Kansas&rdquo; as
politicians always use such opportunities, and they
made an appeal to the Revolutionary tradition by
calling their convention on the anniversary of the
battle of Bunker Hill, June 17. They had not a

<i>bona fide</i> delegation from any Southern State. But
the Declaration of Independence, overlooked by both
parties for many years, was made a part of the platform.
The Pacific railway was indorsed and internal
improvements at federal expense were again recommended
to the country. John C. Fr&eacute;mont, son-in-law
of Benton and an explorer of national fame, was
nominated for the Presidency. The campaign had
already been waging since the introduction of the
Kansas-Nebraska Bill. It now became intense.
Douglas gave Buchanan his loyal support, and the
great Southern planters united with New York merchants
and New England conservatives to make the
Democratic ticket successful. Even Edward Everett
and Rufus Choate made public announcement of
their conversion to Democracy. Large sums of money
were sent to Pennsylvania to influence the vote.
Southern governors in a conference at Raleigh proposed
secession if the Democrats failed, and Eastern
radicals urged the break-up of the Union if the slave
power continued in control.</p>

<p>The result was a victory for the conservatives, or
&ldquo;reactionaries,&rdquo; as we should perhaps say. The solid
South voted for Buchanan; and Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Illinois, and California were found in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
column. Fr&eacute;mont received the support of a solid
East and all the Northwest except the States just
mentioned. The fear of radicalism and the distrust
of men of great wealth everywhere had defeated the
young Republicans; the returns showed that the
Democrats had polled 200,000 more votes than in
1852, and there was no reason to believe that the
874,000 which had been cast for Fillmore would not
in the end be given to the conservative Democrats
in preference to the sectional Republicans. There
was no chance for the enthusiastic followers of
Seward and Chase unless the majority party could be
broken into factions, and this a wise and able Democratic
leadership would avoid.</p>

<p>Strangely Buchanan formed his Cabinet without
consulting Douglas, so far as can now be ascertained.
No friend of his was appointed to high office, yet the
support of the Northwest was the one condition of
continued success. In the foreign policy the new
Administration made no change. A part of northern
Mexico and all of Cuba were still coveted and, till
the outbreak of the Civil War, efforts were made to
obtain both. Howell Cobb, of Georgia, was the master
spirit of the Cabinet, and Jefferson Davis was
the Administration leader in the Senate.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, composed of seven pro-Southern
members as against two anti-slavery men, undertook
to give a <i>coup de grace</i> to the quarrel about
slavery in the Territories. The Missouri Compromise
had never been passed upon by the court. Now a
case came before the august tribunal which gave
opportunity for the judges to say whether slavery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
could be prohibited by federal authority in the public
domain. Dred Scott, a slave belonging to a Missouri
master, had been carried into Minnesota and
there held in bondage. He sued for his freedom on
the ground that slavery was unlawful in free territory,
under the Compromise. The case was before
the court nearly a year before the judges gave out
their opinion that Scott was not a citizen of the
United States, and that, therefore, he could not sue
in the federal courts. The case was dismissed. But
the judges granted a rehearing of the case, and in
March, 1857, hoping to assist the country to a peaceful
solution of the slavery problem, gave out a so-called
<i>dictum</i>, which it had been the custom of the
court occasionally to submit to the public.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In this
document the judges said that the negro was property,
and that as such the Federal Government
must protect it in the Territories. This was the Calhoun
doctrine, and the South rejoiced immoderately;
the Republicans now began to realize that the courts
were in alliance with the slave-power, and they were
forced to attack the most sacred political institution
in the country.</p>

<p>Both parties turned to Kansas to see what could be
won there. During the spring of 1856, when Sumner
and Brooks were manifesting the spirit of the members
of Congress, the Southern and Northern groups
in Kansas carried their warfare to similar extremes.
Lawrence was destroyed by the pro-slavery men;
the anti-slavery men returned the stroke in the mas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>sacres
on Pottawatomie Creek. John Brown, a fanatical
New England emigrant, imagined himself
to be commissioned of Heaven to kill all the pro-slavery
people who fell into his hands, and he did a
bloody work which under other conditions would have
been counted as murder and denounced everywhere.
But in the autumn of 1856 wealthy and benevolent
men in the North applauded him, gave him money,
and held meetings in his honor.</p>

<p>Into a Kansas frenzied with the work of Brown
on the one side and that of the &ldquo;border ruffians,&rdquo;
as the Missourians were called, on the other, the
President sent Robert J. Walker as governor, commissioned
to solve the insoluble problem. So great
was the faith of the country in Walker that he was
hailed as the next President of the United States by
fair-minded men and important newspapers. Walker
called an election for a constitutional convention.
Again the Missourians participated, and the Lecompton
constitution was the result. The Free-State
men refused to recognize the convention unless the
new constitution should be submitted to a fair vote.
This the convention refused to do, and the governor
appealed to the President to compel submission. This
was denied, and Walker resigned. The Lecompton,
pro-slavery constitution of Kansas was submitted to
the first Congress of Buchanan in December, 1857,
and the Administration urged its adoption. Walker
openly condemned Buchanan for deserting him, and
he declared the Lecompton constitution to be a fraud.
Yet the leaders of the South, resentful and angry,
supported it, and the majority of the Senate was on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the same side. The judges of the Supreme Court
were known to favor it. The Republicans urged the
adoption of the Topeka constitution of 1855, and the
majority of the people seemed to be of the same
view. What was the way out of the dangerous <i>impasse</i>?</p>

<h4>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h4>

<p>The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill had
greatly angered a majority of the people of the North.
The sudden rise of the Republican party in protest
against it, and the promise of Northern control of
the Federal Government, heartened them to the great
struggle of 1856. But the failure to win the populous
States of Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Illinois, and the
solid front of the South, the compact pro-Southern
Senate, and the moral effect of the Dred Scott decision
discouraged them. Moreover, the Republican
victories of 1854-55 proved misleading, for in 1856
and 1858 the party failed to win a majority in the
House of Representatives. All that the ardent protestants
and idealists could do was to block extreme
measures in Congress and enact laws in the Republican
States to harass the &ldquo;enemy.&rdquo; Seward yielded
the struggle to the extent of indorsing popular sovereignty,
which did indeed promise more than any other
line of procedure. Greeley, the enemy of Seward
but the arch-enemy of the South, actually proposed
Douglas, the &ldquo;squire of slavery,&rdquo; for the Presidency
in 1860. Chase seemed to be losing ground in Ohio,
where he had never had a majority on his own account.
Business, as we have already seen, had made
peace with the South, and conservative leaders of
the East regarded slave-owners as in the same class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>

morally with bankers and railway directors.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
federal law against the African slave trade could not
be enforced. More than a hundred ships sailed unmolested
each year from New York Harbor to the
African Coast to bring back naked negroes for the
cotton planters.</p>

<p>The outlook was so dark that New England leaders
returned regretfully to the proposition of John
Quincy Adams of 1843, and recommended Northern
nullification and secession. Massachusetts had
passed an act in 1855 which inflicted a penalty of
five years of imprisonment upon any man who aided
in the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law of the
United States. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin
had declared the same law unconstitutional in 1854;
in 1857 the legislature indorsed this view, and in
1859 it claimed the right of immediate secession
in case the State was overruled by the Federal Supreme
Court, or in case any attempt should be made
to enforce the obnoxious act by the General Government.
Nearly every other Northern State passed
personal liberty laws which were designed to prevent
the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, and their
constitutional justification was found in the supremacy
of the States and bolstered by the opinion of
Judge Story, delivered in 1842,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which said that
no private citizen need obey an unconstitutional law,
state or national, but he takes the risk of having the
courts decide it constitutional and of being punished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
if he acts on his own judgment before the proper
court has adjudged the act unconstitutional.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural, then, that Charles Sumner
should indorse the abolitionist campaign against the
Union, or that Benjamin F. Wade should eulogize
the Wisconsin threats to secede. Richard H. Dana,
of Boston, said that men who had called him a traitor
a few years before now stopped him on the street to
talk treason. N. P. Banks, the Speaker of the House
of Representatives, said in Maine: &ldquo;I am not one of
the class who cry for the perpetuation of the Union.&rdquo;

The Worcester convention of January 15, 1857, did
actually and by big majorities pass resolutions calling
for a dissolution of the Federal Government, and
its call for a convention of all the free States, looking
to the same end, was signed by seven hundred men
of all walks of life; many of them were men of eminence.
The political abolitionists and the anti-slavery
men of pronounced views were on the point of going
over to the Garrison party, which had always proclaimed
that the Union was a &ldquo;league with hell,&rdquo;
and so strong was the campaign against the Union
that Governor Wise, of Virginia, and others recommended
a war upon New England in order to bring
the abolitionists to subjection.</p>

<p>But the darkest hour comes just before dawn.
When Buchanan recommended in the message of
December, 1857, the admission of Kansas under
the Lecompton constitution, Senator Douglas, to the
bewilderment of thousands, openly denounced the
President, and in the most effective speech of his life
led a secession of the Northwestern Democrats from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the dominant Southern party. He showed that the
application of his popular sovereignty doctrine in
Kansas would solve the problem of slavery in the
Territories, and that the Administration was violating
the platform on which it held office in espousing
the cause of the pro-slavery men. It was a remarkable
situation. In 1854 Douglas had defeated Davis
and Pierce in their far-reaching plans for the development
of the Southwest; Chase and his allies had
defeated Douglas in his counter-scheme for the growth
of the Northwest in 1854-55; and now Douglas
broke the solidarity of the Democratic party and gave
hope and courage to the North, where the idea of
secession was fast winning the minds of leading men.
If Douglas joined the Republicans, the overthrow of
the South was assured; if he became an independent
candidate for the Presidency, the Republicans were
made certain of an easy victory. It was this that
prompted Greeley to indorse Douglas in 1857, and
caused Seward to say a good word for his rival and
opponent.</p>

<p>Buchanan read Douglas out of the party. Jefferson
Davis denounced him as worse than a demagogue.
Judges of the Supreme Court expressed their contempt
for &ldquo;the ambitious perpetual candidate.&rdquo; No
settlement of the Kansas question was possible under
these circumstances. Douglas returned to Illinois in
the summer of 1858 to open his campaign for re&euml;lection
to the Senate. He had never been so popular
before. Chicagoans who had denounced and spurned
him as a traitor to his country in 1854 now gave
him the greatest ovation that city had ever given to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>

any one. Big business men, railroad builders, and
laboring men hastened to give him assurance of their
favor. Even partisan opponents went over to the
&ldquo;new&rdquo; Douglas. In fact, the people saw that his
popular sovereignty idea had been misunderstood. It
was already working out Northwestern or Free-State
control of the Territories, and the fear of losing the
Territories had been the motive for following Chase
and Sumner in 1854.</p>

<p>But the Republicans of the Northwest had been
planning to make an end of the &ldquo;Little Giant,&rdquo; the
man who was the most feared of all the public leaders
of the time. Abraham Lincoln was to be his successor
in the Senate. Norman B. Judd, Joseph
Medill, and John Wentworth were the astute advisers
of the new party in their section. Seward,
Weed, and even John J. Crittenden, the popular
successor of Henry Clay in the United States Senate,
advised the Illinois Republicans not to oppose
Douglas, since Douglas was already doing the Democrats
more mischief than any new Republican Senator
could hope to do. The Eastern leaders were concerned
about the campaign of 1860, and naturally
they cultivated the differences of their opponents.</p>

<p>Lincoln was also making plans for 1860, and a
defeat of Douglas in his own State would be a political
event of the first magnitude. And there was
much promise of success. Had they not elected
Lyman Trumbull in 1855 in spite of all the &ldquo;great
man&rdquo; could do? Moreover, the Administration had
withdrawn all patronage from Douglas, and postmasters'
heads were falling fast in Illinois. Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>

Buchanan was just then putting up anti-Douglas
tickets in many of the counties, in the expectation
of electing a legislature hostile to Douglas if not
friendly to the Washington authorities. Was there
ever a better chance for the new group of leaders?
Contrary to Eastern advice they nominated Lincoln
as the opponent of Douglas, and that shrewd man
and able logician challenged the Senator to a joint
debate, and the most important political discussion in
our history followed.</p>

<p>Lincoln had declared in a recent speech that &ldquo;a
house divided against itself could not stand,&rdquo; and the
United States he likened to the divided house. Douglas
seized upon this to show the country what a radical
abolitionist Lincoln was, for was it not a disruption
of the Union of which he spoke so cogently,
and which the abolitionists were just now urging?
Nothing was more unpopular in the Northwest than
disunion. All the papers of the country now printed
what Lincoln had said, and with Douglas's disparaging
comment. The business interests of the East
shuddered at the Lincoln parable.</p>

<p>But Lincoln took occasion at Freeport to make
Douglas even more unpopular in the South than he
already was, by asking him if he did not support the
Dred Scott decision; also if he still adhered to the
popular sovereignty doctrine as a means of settling
the slavery problem in the Territories. Douglas answered
in the affirmative to both queries. Whereupon
Lincoln showed that if the Dred Scott decision
held, Congress must protect slavery in all the Territories
and if the popular sovereignty idea prevailed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the squatters of any Territory might by popular vote
prohibit slavery in any Territory. Hence, according
to Douglas, slavery could be lawfully maintained
and lawfully abolished at the same time and place.
Douglas recognized his predicament; but he replied
that, in spite of the court's decision, the settlers of a
new Territory might by &ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo; local legislation
make slavery impossible. When the papers of
the country published this lame reply, Southern men
everywhere denounced in unmeasured terms &ldquo;the
demagogue who promised one thing in Congress and
another in Illinois.&rdquo; The Lincoln-Douglas campaign
continued all the autumn, and the country became
acquainted with the obscure lawyer who had persisted
in his purpose to run against Douglas contrary
to the counsels of the leaders of his party. However,
Douglas was re&euml;lected to the Senate, to the
great chagrin of both Lincoln and the President.</p>

<p>After the excitement following the break of Douglas
with his party, the Republican newspapers, which
had urged Douglas as their candidate for 1860, returned
to their partisan attitude. To most people it
seemed clear that Seward should be the Republican
candidate in the next campaign, and Seward was
also convinced that his own nomination was necessary
and inevitable. The conservative wing of the
party in the East, and especially New England, was
devoted to him. As time went on the prize seemed
more and more certain, though there were other
competitors in the field. Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania,
Chase, of Ohio, Lincoln, of Illinois, and
Edward Bates, of Missouri, were &ldquo;favorite sons.&rdquo; For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the Democrats the outlook was anything but cheering.
The &ldquo;regulars&rdquo; could not speak of Douglas
but with imprecations. Although Douglas controlled
absolutely all the Democratic organizations in eight
Northwestern States, if we include Missouri, a most
strenuous campaign was waged from Washington
against him in the hope of getting control of the
general committee of the next convention. John
Slidell, of Louisiana, and August Belmont, agent of
the Rothschilds, in New York, guided the maneuvers.
In December, 1859, when Douglas entered
upon his new term with an air of triumph, the Senate
majority, led by Jefferson Davis, promptly removed
him from the chairmanship of the Committee
on Territories, which was the signal for the opening
of the fierce political war that preceded the assembling
of the Democratic Convention in Charleston.</p>

<p>Meanwhile John Brown, influenced by the political
currents then running in favor of the North, led
a small band of men into western Virginia. The object
was to start a slave insurrection and in the end set
free all the negroes of the South. Brown received or
was promised $25,000 and was supported by men of
the first respectability. On October 16, 1859, Brown
seized the United States Arsenal at Harper's Ferry
and called upon the slaves to rise against their masters.
In the fighting which ensued Colonel Washington,
a grand-nephew of General Washington, was
wounded; but few took notice of names in that first
onset of the Civil War or thought of the common
history of the sections. Governor Wise, of Virginia,
hastened the militia to the scene, and Captain Robert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
E. Lee led a small force of United States troops to
the relief of the endangered community. Brown
failed in his efforts to arouse the negroes, who were
not the restless and resentful race they were thought
to be. He was soon surrounded and captured. A few
people were killed, but the institution of slavery was
not touched.</p>

<p>But the noise of the attack was heard around the
world. In the North men of the highest standing
proclaimed Brown a hero. At the time of his execution
in December so thoughtful a man as Emerson
compared Brown's gallows to the cross of Jesus of
Nazareth. For a time the social conscience of the
East, at least, sensed this attack as a blow against
the common <i>Erbfeind</i>, as the Germans say of the
French. It was the &ldquo;arrogant South&rdquo; that had been
struck. But when the Congressional investigation
was held, Republican leaders and religious organizations
everywhere insisted that they had never known
the man, though there was a widespread feeling that
it would be wise for the Governor of Virginia not
to visit the death penalty upon the &ldquo;deluded&rdquo; prisoner.</p>

<p>Governor Wise was not the man to forgive an
assault on the Old Dominion, and he never thought
of granting a pardon. He urged Virginia to reorganize
her militia, and he filled the state armory with
some of the weapons which were used with fatal
effect at First Bull Run. Other Southern States
followed the example of Virginia and laid in supplies
for a conflict which many thought inevitable.
Nor was it without significance that new military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
companies and regiments were organized and drilled
in many parts of the North during the year 1860.</p>

<p>After months of angry and useless debates in
Washington, the leaders of the Democratic party
gathered in Charleston in April, 1860, to nominate
their candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency.
No other town in the United States was
more unfriendly to the cause of the leading candidate,
Douglas. As the delegates gathered, it was
seen that every delegation from every Northwestern
State was instructed to vote as a unit for Douglas,
and it became evident that a safe majority would
insist on his nomination. The enthusiasm of the followers
of the &ldquo;Little Giant&rdquo; surpassed all similar
demonstrations at previous conventions. On the
other hand, the committee on resolutions was opposed
to Douglas, and by a vote of 17 to 16 it reported
a platform which was simply a restatement
of the Dred Scott decision, adding only that the
Federal Government was bound by the Constitution
to protect slavery in the Territories. When this report
was read in the convention the Douglas majority
rejected it, and accepted the minority report,
which was the &ldquo;popular sovereignty&rdquo; of Douglas
and the platform of 1856, for which all the South
had stood in the campaign of that year. The convention
was deadlocked, for the South could defeat
Douglas for the nomination under the two-thirds
rule, and Douglas could prevent the adoption of any
Southern program or the nomination of any candidate
other than himself. On Sunday, April 30, the
clergy and the congregations of the city prayed as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
never before for a peaceable solution of the problem
before the country, and every one seemed to recognize
the gravity of the situation. On Monday evening,
William L. Yancey, &ldquo;the fire-eater&rdquo; of Alabama,
after a most remarkable speech, broke the
deadlock by leading a bolt of practically all the
lower Southern States. The Tammany Hall delegation
of New York followed. The bolters held a meeting
in another hall and called a convention of their
element of the party in Richmond in June. The
Douglas majority likewise adjourned a day or two
later to meet in Baltimore at the same time.</p>

<p>The historic Jacksonian party had broken into
factions. Each faction nominated a candidate. The
Southerners, supported by the Buchanan Administration,
named John C. Breckinridge, a moderate, in
the vain hope of winning some Northern States; the
Douglas men offered, of course, their favorite, and
insisted that theirs was the only true Union ticket.
A third convention was called to meet in Baltimore,
and its nominees were John Bell, of Tennessee, and
Edward Everett, of Massachusetts. This was the
remnant of the Know-Nothings of 1856. They asked
for the maintenance of the Union as it was; but in
the ensuing election they polled three hundred thousand
fewer votes than Fillmore had received in 1856.</p>

<p>The Republicans met in Chicago about the middle
of May, the advantage of local sentiment being in
Lincoln's favor. The Seward men and their &ldquo;rooters&rdquo;
came in trainloads from New York and Boston,
and both in Chicago and Charleston a plentiful supply
of whiskey had its share in the manufacture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
enthusiasm. Cameron was the stumbling-block of
the conservative Eastern Republicans, and he was
expected to command his price. Horace Greeley, cast
out of the Republican camp by the Seward men in
New York, came as a delegate from Oregon, and he
was busy from morn till night trying to defeat Seward.
Chase, Lincoln, and Bates, though they were
not in the convention, were doing what they could to
defeat the great New York leader on the ground that
he could not possibly carry Indiana and Illinois. It
was more than a friendly rivalry.</p>

<p>In drafting the platform no reference was to be
made to the idealistic Declaration of Independence, so
popular in 1856; but the resolute threat of a bolt,
by Joshua R. Giddings, caused a reconsideration and
the adoption of the brief reference which one reads
in the historic document. All raids into States or
Territories were duly denounced, and slavery itself
was guaranteed in all its rights. The Pacific railroad
scheme of Douglas was again indorsed, and the old
land policy of the West found expression in the free
homestead plank. The tariff ideas of Clay appeared
in a clause which promised protection to American
industry, better wages to American labor, and higher
prices for farm products. One sees here the genius of
political management, not the fire of reformers, and
if the Southerners had kept cool they could have read
between the lines of this declaration all the guarantees
that they required, save alone on the subject of
slavery in the new Territories, which the Republicans
could not possibly yield and hold their followers
together. It was an alliance of the East and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Northwest, arranged by Seward in much the same
way that Calhoun arranged the combination of 1828
which raised Jackson to the Presidency.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the country and especially of the
East, Cameron, Greeley, and Bates proved able to
defeat Seward, and Lincoln was nominated. Many
people of the East had never heard of the successful
candidate till they read in the papers that he had
won. Lincoln was moderate in temper and conciliatory
in tone, like the platform, but he was a sincere
democrat, one who was in mind and thought one of
the people. The great men of the party who had
borne the burden and heat of the day felt outraged.
Sumner never forgave Lincoln for his lack of culture,
and for a time it seemed that Seward would not
give his humble rival the support necessary to success.

&ldquo;The rail-splitter&rdquo; of Illinois was ridiculed in
the older Republican States as no other presidential
candidate had been since &ldquo;Old Hickory&rdquo; offered himself
as against the seasoned statesmanship of John
Quincy Adams. The gentry of the East were in a
worse plight than were the Southern statesmen of
1828, for Lincoln was more of a democrat than
Jackson had been.</p>

<p>But if certain classes of the East accepted mournfully
the candidate of their party, the plain people
everywhere, farmers, mechanics, shopkeepers, and
the smaller industrial interests, rejoiced that one of
their own had been selected. While it is not likely
that this caused many changes from one party to another,
it did tend to bring out the vote and prevent
the election from going to the House. Professional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
abolitionists could not honestly support the platform
of the Republicans, but anti-slavery men, old-line
Whigs, half of the former Know-Nothing party, and
all of those who had so long feared or hated the
South could cheerfully vote for Lincoln. In the
Northwest it was an evenly matched contest. Douglas
was only a little less popular than his great rival,
the cause of his final defeat being the decision of the
German element to cast in their lot with the Republicans.
Carl Schurz, one of the best men who ever
took part in American public life, and a radical of
the radicals, exercised a decisive influence and turned
the tide in Illinois and Iowa, where a few thousand
votes lost would have defeated Lincoln. Though the
enthusiasm of the Republicans was not so great as
it had been in 1856, the people of the East and the
Northwest did unite against the South, as planned in
the Chicago platform, which so well represented the
interests of the combination.</p>

<p>The South gave every evidence that secession
would follow the election of Lincoln, and when the
Maine campaign indicated that Lincoln would surely
be chosen, Douglas gave up his canvass in the Northwest
and went South in the hope of saving the Union
by urging the leaders there that secession would mean
war. In Virginia, North Carolina, and Alabama he
foretold plainly the awful consequences of secession.
But the lower South paid little heed; their leaders,
Rhett and Yancey, were ready to take the first steps
to disrupt the Union upon the receipt of news that
the Democrats had lost the election. To them Lincoln
was not only a democrat who believed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
equality of men before the law; he was also a &ldquo;black
Republican,&rdquo; the head of a sectional party whose
platform bespoke sectional interests and the isolation
of the South.</p>

<p>In the end Lincoln received a popular vote slightly
greater than that of Buchanan in 1856, and the electoral
vote of every State from Maine to Iowa and
Minnesota. Douglas received a larger vote than Fr&eacute;mont
had received, but only twelve electoral votes.
It was plain that the people of the North were by no
means unanimous, and that Lincoln would have great
difficulty in carrying out any severely anti-Southern
measures, especially as the Republicans had failed to
carry a majority of the congressional districts. Thus
the blunders of Douglas and Chase in 1854 had
started the dogs of sectional warfare, and now a solid
North confronted a solid South, with only two or
three undecided buffer States, like Maryland and
Missouri, between them.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln, born in Kentucky of Virginia
parentage, married to a Southern woman, accustomed
from boyhood to the narrow circumstances of
the poor, and still unused to the ways of the great,
was called to the American Presidency. He was not
brusque and warlike as Jackson had been; he was a
kindly philosopher, a free-thinker in religion at the
head of an orthodox people, or peoples. A shrewd
judge of human character and the real friend of the
poor and the dependent, Lincoln, like his aristocratic
prototype, Thomas Jefferson, believed implicitly in
the common man. He was ready to submit anything
he proposed to a vote of the mass of lowly people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
who knew little of state affairs and who never expected
to be seen or heard in Washington. People
who had preached democracy to Europe for nearly
a century had now the opportunity of submitting to
democracy. It was the severest test to which the
Federal Government had ever been subjected.</p>

<h4>THE APPEAL TO ARMS</h4>

<p>Though the South had voted as a unit for Buchanan
in 1856 and her leaders had long acted in concert
on important matters, the election of Lincoln
by a &ldquo;solid&rdquo; North was regarded by most owners of
slaves as a revolutionary act; and the Southern
reply to the challenge was secession. The idea of
secession was familiar in 1860. In 1794 New England
leaders in Congress had discussed such a remedy
when it seemed certain that the Southerners would
gain permanent control of the national machinery,
and Westerners contemplated the same remedy for
ills they could not otherwise cure during the period
of 1793 to 1801. Rather than submit to the burdensome
embargo and the more burdensome second war
with England, most New England men of property
seem to have preferred the dissolution of a union
which was formed for commercial purposes; and we
have seen how Webster urged resistance to the national
tariff in 1820 even to the point of advising
secession. The rightful means of local self-defense
was a break-up of the confederacy, until in 1830
Jackson, speaking for the West, and Webster, speaking
for the rising industrial group of the Northeast,
announced that the Union was indissoluble and that
an attempt to sever it would be accounted treason.
A sense of nationality had come into existence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>

a permanent, &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; union of all the States was
the corollary of that belief.</p>

<p>Still, when the South, with its resolute program
of expansion and the vigorous national control which
characterized the Democratic Administrations from
Polk to Buchanan, made slavery a cardinal tenet of
its faith, legislatures and courts of the East refused
to regard either the Constitution or the federal law
as paramount and abiding. Secession was a common
word among the constituents of New England
Senators after 1840, and even Northwestern States
threatened disruption of the Union as late as 1859
if the national policy should continue to run counter
to their interests. There was, however, a strong
undercurrent of devotion to the idea of nationality
in both North and South<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in 1860, and when
South Carolina proceeded with her long-contemplated
scheme of secession early in November of
that year, Jefferson Davis, who had formerly talked
freely of that &ldquo;last remedy&rdquo; of minority interests,
advised against the movement; and everywhere North
and South men of great wealth, as well as the poorer
people, who must always bear the heaviest burdens
of war, deprecated and warned against the application
of a remedy which all sections had at one time
or another declared right and lawful. As men came
nearer to the application of their &ldquo;rightful&rdquo; remedy,
the older and cooler heads urged the leaders of South
Carolina not to withdraw from the national confederation.
Republicans like Seward and Weed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>

Lincoln exerted themselves to the utmost to dissuade
the Southern radicals; all the influence of the
Bell and Everett party was cast into the same side
of the scales; and Congress, when it assembled in
December, 1860, was pressed from every possible
angle to arrange some compromise which would satisfy
the angry element in the lower South. Even
Republicans of the more radical type offered to do
anything, except assent to the further expansion of
slavery in the Territories, in order to prevent the
formation of a Southern Confederacy and the expected
paralysis of business.</p>

<p>Nothing availed. South Carolina, under the leadership
of Robert Barnwell Rhett, called a state convention
which met in Columbia, but adjourned to
Charleston, and on December 20 severed all connection
with the National Government and recalled her
Representatives in Congress. President Buchanan
did not favor secession, and he hoped that some way
might be found to settle the difficulties which underlay
the crisis. In his message to Congress he declared
that there was no right of secession, but that
there was also no authority anywhere to prevent secession.
This was at the time the view of most others
in the North, perhaps in the South, for Southerners
spoke frequently of the &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; they were
precipitating. When the demand of South Carolina
for the surrender of Fort Sumter was presented to
the President, he decided to delay action until his
successor was inaugurated. This was not irregular
nor unusual, but gave the people of the South time to
decide what they would do; and before February 1,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
1861, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and
Louisiana withdrew from the Union, though not
without strenuous resistance by large parties in all
these communities, save Florida. Early in February
delegates from these States gathered in Montgomery,
Alabama, and organized a Southern Confederacy on
the model of the older Union, and made Jefferson
Davis President. Alexander Stephens, who had done
more than any other Southerner to delay and defeat
secession, was elected Vice-President. The new constitution
was conservative if not reactionary in character.
Slavery was definitely and specifically made
a corner-stone of the new government. The foreign
slave trade was, in deference to border state opinion,
forbidden; but free trade, which had so long been a
bone of contention between the planters of the South
and the manufacturers of the East, was left to the
wisdom of ordinary legislation. In fact many of the
ablest Southern leaders foresaw the establishment of
a protective system in the South. In the same spirit
of statesmanlike compromise, President Davis was
careful to fill the Cabinet and other important posts
with men who represented all phases of opinion, with
former rivals and even decided opponents of the
cause he represented. So cautious and considered
was this program of the new administration that
ardent secessionists declared before the fall of Fort
Sumter that a reunion with the older Federal Government
was the object. And the mild and conciliatory
attitude of William H. Seward, who was considered
as a sort of acting president during the winter
of 1860-61, strengthened this feeling in the South.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
The Southern commissioners whom Davis sent to
Washington to negotiate with the Federal Government
on the subjects of boundaries between the two
countries, the division of the public debt, and the
surrender of forts within Confederate territory were
great favorites in the old national capital. A friendly
attitude toward the new South still further found
expression in the New York <i>Tribune</i>, supposed to
speak for Republicans in general, in the Albany
<i>Journal</i>, Thurlow Weed's paper, and even in the
New York <i>Times</i>, Seward's organ.</p>

<p>In fact the people of the North preferred a permanent
disruption of the Union to a great war, the
inevitable alternative. Nationalist sentiment was
strong in the North, but not strong enough to make
men positive and decided in their actions. President-elect
Lincoln expressed this state of the public mind
in his inaugural, when he said that he would faithfully
execute the laws unless the people, his rightful
masters, should refuse their support, and he showed
it still more clearly when he adopted the policy of
delay in determining the status of Fort Sumter which
his predecessor had so long followed. The Cabinet
of Buchanan had been undecided, that of Lincoln
was for a whole month equally undecided. Men hoped
to avoid what all feared, civil war; and it is to the
credit of both sections and both cabinets that they
hesitated to commit the overt act which was to set
free the &ldquo;dogs of war&rdquo;; and while public opinion
was thus halted at the parting of the ways, Virginia,
still thought of as the great old commonwealth and
mother of statesmen, called a peace congress of North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and South. Delegates from twenty-one States conferred
together in Washington for six weeks, seeking
a way out of the difficult and perilous situation.
Conservative members of Congress, John J. Crittenden,
Stephen A. Douglas, William H. Seward, and
others, labored in the same cause. It is acknowledged
by all that a popular referendum would have
brought an overwhelming mandate to let the &ldquo;departing
sisters go in peace,&rdquo; or to accept the former
Southern demand of a division of the western territory
from Kansas to the Pacific along the line of
36&deg; 30'.</p>

<p>But stiff-backed Republicans like Senator Chandler,
of Michigan, Charles Sumner, and Secretary
Chase were unwilling to throw away the results of a
victory constitutionally won, even to avoid a long and
bloody war. And these men brought all the influence
they could command to bear upon the President
and his Cabinet during the early days of April.
They contended that every moment of delay increased
the likelihood of Southern success, and they urged
that the young Republican party, which was perhaps
as dear to them as the country itself, was losing
ground. At last President Lincoln yielded, and a relief
expedition was ordered to Fort Sumter on April
6, where Major Robert Anderson and his garrison
had bravely and cautiously maintained their difficult
situation in the face of an angry Southern sentiment
for nearly four months. This was recognized as a warlike
move; and Secretary Seward was so much opposed
to it and, the Southerners contended, so sacredly
bound not to allow its departure, that he interfered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>

with the expedition, by sending orders, signed by
himself for the President, intended to thwart the
move.</p>

<p>Under circumstances so peculiar and delicate it
was of the utmost importance that the Confederate
President keep his head. The responsibility for regaining
control of Fort Sumter passed from South
Carolina to the Confederate Government during the
early days of February. Major Anderson, who held
the fort with a small Federal garrison, was a friend
of Jefferson Davis, and was keenly alive to the seriousness
of his situation, and while his superiors were
in doubt, he maintained the status of things as they
were when the negotiations began. But the authorities
of South Carolina forbade the sending of fresh
supplies of provisions to his men after April 6, and,
as there was but a limited amount on hand, it was
only a matter of weeks before he must evacuate, if
neither the North nor the South decided what should
be done. April 15 was the day which he set for giving
up his post for the lack of sustenance. If he
moved away peacefully, there would be no war, and
such was the hope of Seward and the moderates of
the North, who thought that a friendly reconstruction
would be the result of continued delay.</p>

<p>Jefferson Davis, who was informed daily of every
move that was made in Washington, determined to
let Anderson quietly evacuate Fort Sumter, having
assurances from Seward that no supplies would be
sent. In this he was supported by the unanimous
opinion of his Cabinet until on April 9, when General
P. G. T. Beauregard, who commanded the troops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
gathering at Charleston, telegraphed that the Federal
Government had given formal notice that assistance
would be sent to the starving garrison. Davis still delayed,
giving conditional orders to Beauregard; and
Beauregard acted in the same spirit when he sent
Roger A. Pryor and three other aides to the fort to
get definite assurance on the point of Federal surrender.
But when Anderson, on the night of April
12, gave assurance that on April 15 he would give
up his post if he should not receive contrary orders
from Washington prior to that time, the four aides
of General Beauregard who had been sent to the fort
gave notice to the Confederate artillery commander,
without consulting superior authority, that the answer
was not satisfactory, and the fatal shelling began.
On the next day Anderson and his men, finding the
walls of the fort falling about them, surrendered.
The war had begun.</p>

<p>The act of South Carolina on December 20 led
immediately to the formation of the confederacy of
the lower Southern States. The firing on Fort Sumter
was followed in a few days by the secession of Virginia,
Tennessee, and Arkansas, Texas having already
joined the &ldquo;revolution&rdquo;; Maryland, Kentucky, and
Missouri were prevented from joining the new confederacy
only by the prompt and extra-legal interference
of President Lincoln. The second tier of
Southern States thus joined the first, and a confederacy
of some ten million people demanded the independence
which all agreed had not been forbidden
in the Constitution of 1787, and began at once the
raising of armies to make good that demand. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>

boundaries of the new republic were extended to the
Potomac; commissioners were sent to the European
powers to sue for recognition, and hundreds of the
best officers in the United States Army resigned to
seek commands under the new flag.</p>

<p>The popular excitement and enthusiasm which followed
these events in the South equaled that which
marked the early stages of the French Revolution.
Party lines and class distinctions disappeared. Two
hundred thousand volunteers offered their services to
Jefferson Davis; confederate and state bonds to meet
the expense of the war were taken at par wherever
there was surplus money; men met at their courthouses
to drill without the call of their officers;
and women, even more enthusiastic than the men,
urged their &ldquo;guardians and protectors&rdquo; to the front
to meet and vanquish a foe who threatened to invade
the Southern soil. Armories were quickly constructed
in a country which knew little of the mechanic arts;
guns and ammunition were ordered from Europe
and from Northern manufacturers as fast as trusty
agents could make arrangements; shipbuilding was
resorted to on the banks of the sluggish rivers; and
machinists and sailors were imported from the North
and from England to guide the amateurish hands of
the South. Before midsummer four hundred thousand
Southerners were in arms or waiting to receive them.
Colonel Robert E. Lee, accounted the first soldier of
the country, was made a general in the new army.
Joseph E. Johnston, Albert Sidney Johnston, Pierre
G. T. Beauregard, and others accepted with confidence
the commissions of the South, and set hundreds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of younger men, trained at West Point or at the Virginia
Military Institute, to drilling and organizing
the armies rapidly gathering at strategic points along
the frontier, which extended from Norfolk, Virginia,
to the eastern border of Kansas.</p>

<p>The planters had at last made good their threat,
and the aristocratic society of the South was welded
together more firmly than it had ever been before.
Their leaders frankly stated to the world that their
four billions of negro property was of more importance
to them than any federal union which threatened
the value of that property by narrowing the
limits of its usefulness. The negroes knew a great
war was beginning and that they were the objects
of contention; but long discipline and a curious pride
in the prowess of their masters kept them at their
lowly but important tasks. They boasted that their
masters could &ldquo;whip the world in arms.&rdquo; Of insurrections
and the massacre of the whites, which at one
time had been a nightmare to the ruling classes of
the South, there was no rumor. And throughout the
four years of war the slaves remained faithful and
produced by their steady, if slow, toil the food supplies
both for the people at home and for the armies
at the front.</p>

<p>The small slaveholder was the most enthusiastic
and resolute secessionist and supporter of the Confederacy.
He was just rising in the world, and anything
which barred the upward way was denounced
as degrading and insulting. A larger class of Southerners
who joined with measured alacrity the armies
of defense were the small farmers of the hills and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
poorer eastern counties; but the &ldquo;sand-hillers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;crackers,&rdquo; the illiterate and neglected by-products
of the planter counties, were not minded to volunteer,
though under pressure they became good soldiers
because they dreaded the prospect of hordes of
free negroes in the South more than they did the
guns of the North. Small farmers and landless whites
all felt the necessity of holding the slaves in bondage,
and thus a society of sharp class distinctions,
openly acknowledged by all, was moulded into a solid
phalanx by the proposed invasion of the South and
the almost certain liberation of the slaves. Moreover,
the churches of the South, including the Catholics
in New Orleans, Charleston, and elsewhere,
were now at the height of their power. Planters,
farmers, and the so-called &ldquo;poor whites&rdquo; acknowledged
the importance of religious faith and discipline;
and the leaders of the churches, from the
bishops of the Episcopalians to the humble pastors
of negro congregations, freely gave their blessings
to slavery and urged their membership to heroic
sacrifice for the common cause. Sermons like that of
Dr. Palmer, of New Orleans, in November, 1860,
were preached all over the South, and they were as
effective in stirring the warlike impulses of the people
as the fiery addresses of the most enthusiastic
statesmen.</p>

<p>Although there was a unity and a co&ouml;peration
among all classes of people from Washington City
to southwestern Texas, there were certain areas in
which volunteers, even during the early days of excitement,
were not readily forthcoming. In the pine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>

woods of the Carolinas and the Gulf States, where
nine tenths of the soil was still covered by primeval
forests, and among the high mountains of Virginia,
North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, many people
resisted the authority of the Confederacy passively or
actively from the beginning. From the southern Appalachian
region the Union armies drew at least 200,000
recruits, and in certain counties of western North
Carolina and eastern Tennessee more soldiers per thousand
of the population volunteered for the Federal
service than could be found in the most enthusiastic
communities of the North. Western Virginia revolted
in 1861, and in 1863 she was received into
the Union as a loyal State, in spite of the absence
of all constitutional authority or precedent. Eastern
Tennessee might have pursued the same course if
it had been possible for President Lincoln to lend
military assistance at the proper moment. Except in
the valley and southwestern counties of Virginia,
most of the grain and cattle-producing area of the
South was indifferent to the cause of the Confederacy.
This was a serious handicap, for troops must
be stationed in many localities to maintain order, and
the resistance to the foraging agents of the Southern
armies frequently became serious. From the summer
of 1863 to the end of the struggle the home guards
of the various disaffected districts required many
men who might otherwise have been with Lee or
Joseph E. Johnston.</p>

<p>But the better parts of the South, the tobacco and
cotton belts, with their annual output of three hundred
millions' worth of exportable commodities, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
high-strung, well-bred gentry accustomed to outdoor
life and horseback riding and devoted to the idea of
local autonomy in government, were behind the Confederate
movement. The people had been better
trained in their local militia than their Northern
brethren, their greatest families had long been accustomed
to send cadets to West Point, and in several
States there were excellent military schools
where the best of training was given to young men
who looked forward with a vague expectation to careers
in the army. If we add to these considerations
the fact that the rural aristocracy, whether secessionist
or unionist in politics in 1860, regarded the
movements of the North in the spring of 1861 as
ruthless attacks upon their ideals and their homes,
we shall understand how the Confederates were able
to organize a powerful and efficient army so early
in the struggle.</p>

<p>The Confederate seat of Government was removed
in May, 1861, from Montgomery to Richmond. The
old Virginia capital, always the center of strong
unionist feelings, became the scene of cabinet meetings,
of sessions of Congress, and military conferences.
The easy-going tobacco gentry who had
grown up with the little city on the James welcomed
the invasion of generals, politicians, and army contractors,
and saw with pleasure the population swell
from some twenty-five thousand to a hundred thousand
souls. The &ldquo;White House&rdquo; became the center
of a society which, as Mrs. Pryor and others insisted,
was really aristocratic. The first families of Virginia
became hosts to the statesmen who had gathered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
there from all the Southern States; there were
&ldquo;heroes from the wars&rdquo; to grace the salons of Mrs.
Stannard, Mr. William H. McFarland, banker to
the new government, and others who, but for the
disastrous turn of the conflict, would have become
well-known figures in history. The social life which
was adorned by the presence of Mrs. Jefferson Davis,
Mrs. James Chesnut, and Mrs. Joseph E. Johnston
was, however, after one short winter of pleasure and
buoyant expectation, overcast with sorrow and even
scattered abroad by the close approach of the armies
of the North, the hated Yankees who had not been
expected to fight.</p>

<p>The serious and all-absorbing business of the
South was therefore to repel invasion. Armies ranging
from 5000 to 15,000 troops were stationed at
Norfolk, Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, northern
Virginia, Harper's Ferry, Cumberland Gap, Bowling
Green and Columbus, Kentucky, and even in
Missouri. General A. S. Cooper, of New Jersey,
became adjutant-general and the senior officer in the
Confederate Army; Robert E. Lee organized and
drilled the Virginia forces; Joseph E. Johnston, his
rival in the old United States Army, commanded at
Harper's Ferry; and Beauregard, the hero of Fort
Sumter, was at the head of the army which was expected
to resist and defeat the first invasion from
Washington. Behind these various gatherings of
soldiers were hundreds of thousands of others, waiting
to be supplied with arms and ready to learn
the ways of war. Editors, preachers, and orators
heralded with unanimous voice the new nation, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
predicted speedy recognition by the powers of Europe
and a permanent peace with their long-time rivals.
Three months, six months, or a year were the various
estimates of the duration of the war for independence.
Some planters followed the counsel of
President Davis and planted corn and wheat instead
of the accustomed cotton and tobacco, in order to be
able to feed their armies and &ldquo;their people,&rdquo; but
others were so certain that another autumn would
reopen the channels of commerce to all that they
continued their large acreage in their favorite staples.
It was not to be a long struggle like that which
Washington had led. The conditions were different.
Both England and France would intervene when the
cotton famine began to press. Even so sober a man
as General Lee expected success and thought of his
r&ocirc;le as like that of Washington, who was now the
Southern model and ideal. Davis's friends also spoke
and wrote of him as the &ldquo;second Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus filled with the highest hopes and reminded
daily of the heroic traditions of the former revolution,
the Southerners began their battles. President
Lincoln, loath to admit that war was upon him, called
out 75,000 three months' men when the news of Fort
Sumter reached him. Congress, too, was called in
extra session for July 4 to devise ways and means of
compelling the South to return to the fold. These
warlike acts, to those who did not understand the long
sectional rivalry, were supported by an almost unanimous
North. The Northwest, led by Douglas, was
prompt to support their first real President and to
hasten their quota of volunteers to the front. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
older sections of the East the latent hostility toward
the people of the South flamed out as never before,
proclaiming a devotion to the Union and to the ideals
of the Fathers which had widespread effect. Even
in the great cities, where the prevailing sentiment in
the preceding winter had been for peace and a permanent
disruption of the Union, men rallied to the
national standards with unexpected enthusiasm. The
Astors, Belmonts, and Drexels raised regiments or
offered loans to the Administration. If the South
was united and ready to defend their homes, the
North seemed equally united upon a program of invasion
and subjection. A solid South had begotten
a solid North. The shells which burst over Fort
Sumter had called the North to arms as effectively
as they had banished the hesitation of the Southern
border States.</p>

<p>An army of invasion gathered rapidly in Washington,
seized Arlington, General Lee's ancient family
estate, on the Virginia shore of the Potomac, for
a drill ground, took possession of recalcitrant Maryland,
and made of all railroads entering the capital
the highways and instruments of war. Winfield Scott,
the old and vacillating general of the regular army,
was quickly set aside, and the able General Irvin
McDowell took his place. Thirty thousand troops
moved slowly into Virginia under the pressure of
public opinion stimulated by newspaper editors, ministers
of the Gospel, and stiff-backed Republicans,
who, like similar classes in the South, declared that
the war was to be over in three months. Other
armies collected at Cincinnati under young George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
B. McClellan, soon to be major-general, at Louisville
under Don C. Buell, and at St. Louis under the erratic
John C. Fr&eacute;mont. When Congress met, all
these movements were quickly ratified, and the two
sections of a country of more than thirty million
people, all supposed to be devotees of commerce,
industry, and agriculture, &ldquo;worshipers of money,&rdquo;
entered with unparalleled eagerness upon a war which
was soon to surprise and even appall the world. What
industry lost in the North by secession of the South
was regained in the manufacture or preparation of
military supplies for soldiers who fought the South;
and in the Confederacy men who knew little of industry
and of seafaring soon established great plants
where the munitions of war were readily made, or
they turned with a strange facility to improvising
gunboats and blockade runners. Within a year or
two the people of the North showed the most bitter
hatred of the South and everything Southern, and in
the South women sold their hair for the common
cause, and sent their gold and silver ornaments to the
Government to be converted into implements of war.
Such results could hardly have been the outcome of a
hasty decision on either side. The long-nursed dislike
of the people of each section now became a consuming
hatred; it was a mighty struggle for the mastery
of the Government which had been founded in 1787-89,
for the control of the vast territory which composed
the heart of North America. One party or the
other must be vanquished, one section or the other
must become a second Ireland.</p>

<p>On July 20, General McDowell attacked the army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
under General Beauregard near Centreville, a Virginia
village to the northward of a little stream
which gave its name to the battle that ensued,&mdash;Bull
Run. About 35,000 Northerners made up the
army of invasion; Beauregard commanded less than
20,000, but Joseph E. Johnston brought his army
of 15,000 from the Valley of Virginia in time to
decide the fortunes of that hot summer day. After
stout fighting on both sides during the earlier part
of the onset, these fresh troops of the Valley were
seen marching into action. To Union eyes the 15,000
easily appeared to be 30,000. Panic seized men and
officers alike, and a stampede for Washington and
safer ground followed. Arms, provisions, horses, even,
and the carriages of stiff-backed Republican Congressmen,
who had left their posts to see the fun, were left
upon the field and along the wayside as memorials of
the first battle. At the close of the day Jefferson
Davis, Beauregard, Johnston, and &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson,
who won his proud soubriquet on that famous
field, held a conference and decided not to follow
the Federals to Washington that evening. On the
morrow a heavy rain fell and the roads of northern
Virginia became impassable for a week. The defeated
forces had time to regain their composure
while the people of both sections began to see what
war meant.</p>

<p>The Southerners rejoiced and celebrated, even relaxed
their preparations, thinking their valor vastly
superior to that of their enemies. President Davis
was less confident, and pressed upon his Congress
the better organization of the armies, whose numbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
now mounted to 400,000 men; he sent James M.
Mason and John Slidell as commissioners to Europe,
and ordered troops under Robert E. Lee to West
Virginia to save that recalcitrant region to Virginia
and the Confederacy. In the absence of a revenue,
and already shut off from the markets of both the
North and Europe, the Confederates resorted to loans
and the issue of paper money to meet the enormous
expenses of war. The Confederate Government borrowed
hundreds of millions from the planters, and
the States likewise piled up debts in unprecedented
fashion in maintenance of the same great cause. Of
gold and silver there was little; the banks had long
since suspended specie payments, but increased their
issues of notes. The cotton crop, then being harvested
by the negroes, and the grain and cattle of the hill
country were the chief resources. The paper money
of the Government was paid to soldiers, farmers, and
planters for their services and supplies, and this was
given back to the Government in exchange for interest-bearing
bonds that were issued. With a European
market for the planters' products the system might
easily have been successful; but this one essential to
victory failed, or waited upon military success.</p>

<p>The first general election came on in the late autumn.
Under the stimulus of the victory at Manassas,
or Bull Run, Davis and Stephens were elected President
and Vice-President without opposition for terms
of six years. New Senators and Representatives were
chosen, generally from the ranks of conservative politicians,
for the sessions of the regular Confederate
Congress, which was to supersede the provisional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
congress and government on Washington's birthday,
1862. The judiciary of the Confederacy was regularly
organized except as to the Supreme Court; the
adjustments of national and state relations were all
rapidly and easily made; while the selection and
appointment of high officers in the army and civil
administration went steadily on at Richmond, under
the relief from military pressure which the success
of Beauregard and Johnston in northern Virginia
had secured. In the general security some of the
ablest officers of the army, especially Joseph E.
Johnston, felt free to attack the President in the
newspapers because of the failure to give the highest
commands according to rank of officers in the former
United States Army,&mdash;a quarrel which was destined
to have a fatal influence in the final overthrow of the
new government. There was also an attempt to fix
upon Davis the blame for not capturing Washington
City the day after the Bull Run <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>. However,
these were as yet but ripples of discontent which only
proved the general confidence of the people in their
final triumph.</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>F. E. Chadwick's <i>The Causes of the Civil War</i> (1906) and J. K.
Hosmer's <i>The Appeal to Arms</i> (1906) are the best brief and recent
accounts of the events of 1859 to 1862. But Rhodes, McMaster,
and Schouler cover the period to 1876, each after his distinctive
method. John C. Ropes's <i>The Story of the Civil War</i> (1894), continued
by W. R. Livermore, treats the military history in the most
critical and fair-minded way, though Wood and Edmonds's <i>The
Civil War in the United States</i> (1905), and G. P. R. Henderson's

<i>Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War</i> (1900), are equally
good, if somewhat briefer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Of original material there is no limit, and the student is compelled
to find his way through the uncharted wilderness of evidence
in the <i>Rebellion Records</i>, already cited, and the thousands of volumes
of memoirs and special contemporary narratives of which
U. S. Grant's <i>Personal Memoirs</i> (1886), Joseph B. Johnston's
<i>Narrative of Military Operations</i> (1874), Nicolay and Hay's <i>Abraham
Lincoln: a History</i> (1890), and <i>Battles and Leaders of the Civil
War</i> (1887-89), are perhaps the most important. Almost all the
officers of both the Union and Confederate armies, with the unique
exception of General Lee, left published or unpublished narratives
of their r&ocirc;les in the great struggle which help to clear up most
disputed episodes, though they complicate the task of the historian.</p>

<p>The estimates of the numbers of men engaged on both sides by
Ropes, Rhodes, and especially T. L. Livermore in his <i>Numbers and

controverted in both North and South. Each of the great battles
has its historian: H. V. Boynton, <i>The Battle of Chickamauga</i>,

<h4>ONE NATION OR TWO?</h4>

<p>The distressing news of Bull Run brought home
to the North the awful realities of war. Men who
had all along distrusted the Republican party now
denounced a war waged for the emancipation of the
South's slaves. Both the President and Congress
formally announced that it was a struggle for the
maintenance of the Union and not a war on behalf
of the slaves. It was well that this position was
taken, else the North might have broken into impotent
factions. The East hated the South and
warred upon their ancient rivals, the planters; the
border States owned slaves, disliked the Republican
party, and feared the purposes of those in power;
while the West loved the Union, held the negro in
contempt, and was committed to the party in power
on the smallest possible margin.</p>

<p>None but Lincoln seemed to possess the tact and
the ability necessary to hold together these dissolving
elements of a country never yet thoroughly
united; and even he was long doubted and distrusted
by many good men. Strange as it may seem, Douglas
had been, until his death, June 3, 1861, his right
arm. Douglas's last speeches and dying words urged
upon the millions of his followers the necessity of
giving their lives to the cause of the Union. So critical
was the situation that when nominations were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
made for elective office in the Middle States or the
West in 1861, the Administration party took pains
to disavow its former attitude and put forward candidates
who had been regular Democrats, thus following
the same compromising policy which Davis
inaugurated in the South. Daniel S. Dickinson, a
member of the old Polk and Pierce party of ruthless
expansion, was made leader of the Administration
forces in New York in 1861, and David Tod, a
stanch Douglas man in 1860, was elected Governor
of Ohio the same year by Republican votes. John
C. Fr&eacute;mont was removed from the command of
the Federal army in St. Louis because he undertook
to emancipate the slaves in his department.
The people of the North were not willing to invade
the sister States of the South for any other cause
than to restore the Union. Wealthy bankers, industrial
leaders, and railway magnates might be kept
together on a platform of enlarging the area of their
operations, but never on a program which proposed
the confiscation of billions of dollars' worth of property,
which the slaves represented. In this hour of
trial the supreme need was co&ouml;peration and union
among the diverse elements of the North, for in
1862 another Congress would be chosen, and if party
lines were suffered to be drawn, the South would
certainly gain her independence.</p>

<p>With this Unionist program perfectly understood,
Lincoln asked Congress for 400,000 men. Congress
gave him 500,000. A second wave of warlike enthusiasm
swept over the North, and men enlisted not for
three months, but for three years. The zeal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
<i>abandon</i> of the South was hardly matched, but there
was no lack of men or support. With a few exceptions
the newspapers, the pulpits, and the lecture
platforms urged most ardent support of the common
cause. But the more difficult problem of finding
money for the vast armies that moved upon the South
was not so quickly solved. Secretary Chase reported
the expenditure in the three months of June, July,
and August of a hundred millions&mdash;an amount
greater far than the total national debt. Before another
three months had passed this expenditure
had doubled, and the Secretary estimated that
$500,000,000 would be needed before the end of
June, 1862! These were astounding figures to a
country whose normal annual income was about
$50,000,000. And what was worse, the financial
men refused to take government bonds at par, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
they had done during the war with Mexico, although
they were now offered interest at the rate of six to
eight per cent. The country had recovered from the
panic of 1857, and as business activity increased and
the general prosperity became certain, it was more
difficult for the Government to borrow money. The
suspension of specie payments by all the banks before
the end of the year did not mean panic or severe
economic crisis, as had hitherto been the case; rather,
a change from metallic to paper money. Secretary
Chase was told by New York leaders in December,
1862, that government bonds bearing six per cent
interest would hardly bring sixty cents on the dollar.
Yet business men borrowed money at four per cent
and the wheels of industry and commerce were moving
at full speed. Prosperity in the North was thus
almost as fatal to the Union as adversity in the
South was to the Confederacy. Rather than advertise
a collapse of the federal credit by selling bonds
at a discount of twenty to forty per cent the guiding
spirits at Washington decided to issue notes as legal
tender to the amount of $150,000,000, increased to
$300,000,000 a little later. Immediately, bankers
and business men who refused to take bonds protested
with such vigor and resolution that Chase
and Lincoln, unlearned in the ways of finance, knew
not what course to take. To sell bonds at enormous
discounts and high rates of interest was bad; to tax
the people directly for the needs of the Government
would have ruined the party in power; and to issue
fiat money was equivalent to forcing the poor to lend
what the rich refused. But the emergency was great.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>

It was decided to issue and float &ldquo;greenbacks&rdquo;
and also to sell bonds in unprecedented numbers.
Though the markets of the world were open to the
North and business was as active as ever in the
history of the country, the Federal Government was
thus reduced, like the Confederacy, to the use of
paper money, and, surprising as it may appear, the
securities of the latter sold in Europe at a higher
price than those of the former. Gold and silver disappeared
entirely in both sections.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the public were fixed on military
movements, not finance, and as the winter of 1861-62
wore on an army of a hundred thousand men gathered
around Washington for the second invasion of Virginia.
George B. McClellan, the &ldquo;young Napoleon,&rdquo;
drilled and organized the raw recruits while public
opinion began to urge another march upon Richmond.
Other armies nearly a hundred thousand strong spread
over Kentucky and threatened Tennessee at Cumberland
Gap, Bowling Green, and Forts Henry and
Donelson. In February Ulysses S. Grant saw the
strategic importance of the forts on the Cumberland
and Tennessee Rivers, and before the first of March
he had captured both, and the whole of West Tennessee
lay open to him. Nashville fell as he moved
up the Tennessee, and Commodore Foote opened the
Mississippi River almost to Vicksburg during the
early spring. Meanwhile Albert Sidney Johnston
had retreated to northern Mississippi. Finding Grant
in a weak position on the southern bank of the Tennessee
near Shiloh Church, he hastily gathered his discouraged
troops about him for a sudden attack upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the invaders. Grant had nearly 45,000 men and he
knew that General Buell was only a few miles away
with 37,000 more. Johnston had 40,000. The purpose
of the Confederate general was known to his
men, and all were inspired with the determination of
striking a blow before the two armies of the enemy
could unite. Johnston's assistants in command were
Beauregard and Bragg, both able and experienced
officers. On the morning of April 6, the Confederates
fell upon Grant's outposts and drove them
headlong against the main body. Desperate valor was
shown in the ensuing attack, and before the afternoon
it seemed that nothing could save the Union army
and its commander from complete disaster. The river
was in high flood, two impassable creeks flanked the
Federals, while the victorious Confederates held the
fourth side of the field. At two o'clock Johnston fell
mortally wounded; Beauregard succeeded to command,
and about four o'clock the attack slackened;
at six it ceased altogether, though the Union forces
were demoralized and expecting to be captured.
Grant was saved. With the support of Buell at hand
he attacked Beauregard on the morrow and regained
some of his lost prestige. The &ldquo;promenade&rdquo; up the
Tennessee had been halted; but the loss of Johnston
was equal to the loss of an army. This fighting of
South and West was of the most desperate character,
for Grant lost more than 10,000 in killed and
wounded, while Johnston and Beauregard lost 9700.</p>

<p>The march of Grant and Buell across middle and
western Tennessee and the opening of the Mississippi
to Memphis was accompanied by the loss to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the Confederates of Missouri and a part of Arkansas.
Grant's objective in the summer and autumn
of 1862 was Vicksburg, but the Confederates held
him fast in the neighborhood of Corinth, Mississippi.
Buell withdrew from middle Tennessee in
the late summer, when Bragg, commander of a second
Confederate army in the West, moved through
eastern Tennessee into Kentucky, threatening Lexington
and Louisville. But Bragg failed after some
successes in September to carry the tide of war
back toward the Ohio, and he was followed in October
by the army of the Ohio, now under the
command of General W. S. Rosecrans, toward Murfreesboro,
Tennessee, where another sanguinary
battle was fought on the last day of December,
1862. Rosecrans now had 43,000 men, Bragg
38,000. After a desperate encounter in which the
honors inclined to the Confederate side, Bragg withdrew
toward Chattanooga, his base of operations,
and Rosecrans encamped at Murfreesboro. The
Federal losses in this engagement were more than
13,000, the Confederate somewhat over 9000, and
the only advantage was the gaining of a few miles
of territory. The war in the West which began so
brilliantly for the Federals at Forts Henry and
Donelson seemed to have come to a halt. Grant
was unable to penetrate the lower South, and Rosecrans
was content to leave Bragg in undisturbed
possession of the region between Murfreesboro and
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the eyes of the two warring powers
were concentrated on the operations in Virginia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
McClellan moved in March, 1862, upon Richmond
by way of the Yorktown Peninsula, a swampy wild
region over which it was difficult, indeed, to move
an army. He commanded 125,000 men, and 40,000
more were in the neighborhood of Washington to
make a diversion in his favor in case of necessity.
Joseph E. Johnston, who had held chief command
in Virginia since Bull Run, shifted his position
promptly from northern Virginia to Richmond to
meet the threatened attack. He had no more than
55,000 men. As McClellan worked his way slowly
up the peninsula Johnston fortified his position
along the ridges east and north of the Confederate
capital, which stood on the hills just above tidewater.
From Hanover Court-House to Malvern
Hill, a distance of some twenty-five miles, the two
armies confronted each other in irregular lines conforming
to the topography of the region. Late in
May, Johnston attacked McClellan on the Union
right, and the fighting continued two or three days,
now at one point, now at another of the long lines.
On May 31, in the battle of Fair Oaks, Johnston
was severely wounded and the command devolved
upon Robert E. Lee, whose failure to hold West
Virginia against McClellan during the preceding
autumn had temporarily eclipsed his growing reputation.
Lee's management of his forces during the
early days of his new command was faulty; but before
the 23d of June he had received reinforcements
from the Carolinas and Georgia which brought his
total almost to 60,000; and he relied on &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;
Jackson, who was just concluding a wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ful
campaign in the Valley of Virginia, to come to
his assistance with his corps of 16,000. But McClellan
still had 105,000 fairly trained soldiers, and
there was no reason to doubt that a second Union
army was forming near Alexandria. It was a critical
moment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jackson's operations in the Shenandoah
Valley had so startled and astounded the
Federals that he was able to march, June 20-25,
unobserved, over the passes of the Blue Ridge
Mountains to Lee's assistance. A series of battles
began June 26 at Mechanicsville on McClellan's
right, near where Johnston had fought. But the
failure of Jackson to arrive and begin the attack,
according to agreement, caused the first Confederate
onset to fail, with heavy losses to the South.
The next day, however, the tide turned the other
way and Lee routed McClellan at Gaines' Mill.
McClellan now retreated across White Oak Swamp
towards Harrison's Landing on the James. The
weather was hot, the ground soft from rains, and
the underbrush so thick and tangled that men could
not see each other at a distance of ten paces, save
in the narrow roads or small clearings. Realizing
the difficulties under which his opponent labored,
Lee ordered hasty pursuit, and ineffective blows
were struck at Savage's Station and in White Oak
Swamp. Jackson again failed to maintain the great
reputation he had won in the Valley, and Magruder,
Holmes, and Huger, other lieutenants of Lee, not
knowing their own country as well as did the Federals,
suffered their commands to be lost in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
wilderness and thus aided McClellan in his escape
from a dangerous situation. On July 1 the retreating
Union army gathered, still devoted to its commander,
on Malvern Hill, within support of the
Federal gunboats in the James River below. The
Confederates, confident and expectant, poured out
of the woods from every direction, formed in battle
array, and charged over open fields and rising
ground toward the two hundred and fifty great guns
which had been dragged for weeks through the
swamps in the hope of just such an opportunity.
The attempt of Lee to carry this impregnable position
lost the Confederates as many brave men as all
the other six days of unremitting warfare. McClellan
held his own till night; Lee withdrew to the
neighboring thickets, surprised at the resolute
strength of an opponent who had avoided battle at
every turn since June 26.</p>

<p>The week of fighting and scouring the woods had
cost the North nearly 16,000 men; the South, 20,000.
The retreat on July 2 to Harrison's Landing was
McClellan's confession of failure, which sorely distressed
his superiors in Washington and greatly depressed
the spirits of the North. Lee's first essay
at war on a large scale had saved the Confederate
capital, though at fearful cost, and he was everywhere
regarded as a great general. From this time
Davis and the Confederate Government gave him
the fullest confidence, and the people of the South
came to think of him as almost superhuman. Though
he was bold in action and even reckless of human
life, his soldiers gave him an obedience and a rever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>ence
which no other commander in American history
has ever received. Jackson, Longstreet, and D. H.
and A. P. Hill had also won fame in this baptism of
blood. To the average Southerner the outlook was
once more exceedingly bright. Richmond breathed
freely, and the Government bent its energies to the
task of supplying its able officers with men and
means.</p>

<p>While the Federal Government was deciding what
to do with McClellan and his army, still almost
twice as large as Lee's, the Confederate commander
sent Jackson with some 20,000 men to the neighborhood
of Bull Run, where the commands of McDowell,
Banks, and Fr&eacute;mont had been united to
make a third army of invasion. General John Pope
was brought from successful operations in the West
to Washington, where Secretary Edwin M. Stanton,
assuming more and more the directing authority
of the Government, prepared, with the assistance of
Senator Benjamin F. Wade, a proclamation which
Pope was to distribute among the troops. &ldquo;I come
from the West, where we have always seen the backs
of our enemies,&rdquo; ran this remarkable admonition to
Eastern, officers and men. &ldquo;Let us look before us
and not behind.&rdquo; Most of the 50,000 men who were
soon to meet Jackson and Lee resented the comparison
and the affront. On August 9 a sharp encounter
at Cedar Mountain showed how resolute
and real was the purpose of Lee to drive this army
out of Virginia. When President Lincoln removed
McClellan and ordered the Army of the Potomac in
part to Washington, in part to Acquia Creek, near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>

Fredericksburg, to support Pope, and gave the command
of all the armies of the East to General H.
W. Halleck, for whom Grant had won high reputation
earlier in the year, Lee hastened northward to
defeat Pope before these reinforcements could arrive.
The Union forces north of Bull Run amounted now
to nearly 75,000 men; Lee had 55,000, but there
was no thought of delay. On the 29th and 30th
Pope was crushed and routed completely in a series
of maneuvers and battles which have been pronounced
the most masterly in the whole war. For
four days the discouraged and baffled troops and
officers of the Union retreated or ran pell-mell across
the northern counties of Virginia into Washington,
to the dismay of Lincoln and the friends of the
Federal cause. It was at this moment, too, that
Bragg was advancing, as already described, into
Kentucky and threatening to seize Lexington and
Louisville. It was a dark hour to the patient and
patriotic Lincoln, who had never dreamed that such
catastrophes could be the result of his reluctant
decision, in early April, 1861, to hold Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>General Halleck proved uncertain and dilatory;
the Army of the Potomac was generally dissatisfied
and clamoring for the restoration of McClellan, who,
like Joseph E. Johnston, of the South, was always
popular with his men; the Cabinet, too, was uncertain
and hopelessly divided in its counsels. The cause of
the Union was exceedingly doubtful in September,
1862, as Lee entered Maryland, publishing abroad
his call to the Southern element of that State to rise
and join their brethren of the Confederacy. Public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
opinion in the North was divided and depressed.
The abolitionists of the East were pressing every day
through Sumner and Chase for a proclamation emancipating
the slaves, which might have driven Maryland
and Kentucky into the arms of the enemy; the
Northwest was in turmoil, for there abolitionism was as
unpopular as slavery itself, and leading men declared
that it was a war for the Union, for a great common
country, not a struggle to overthrow the institutions
of the South. There was still no great party, sure of
a majority in the coming elections, upon which the
President could rely, and the loss of a majority in
Congress would have been fatal.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Lee, Longstreet, and
Jackson entered Maryland at a point some fifty miles
above Washington, with their army enthusiastic and
self-confident because of recent victories. It seemed
almost certain that another victory, and this on the
soil of the North, would secure Confederate recognition
in Europe. Reluctantly Lincoln restored McClellan
to the command of the Union army which was moving
northwestward to confront Lee. An accident, one of
those small things in war which sometimes determines
the fate of nations, put into McClellan's hands the
orders of Lee for the Maryland campaign. General
D. H. Hill dropped his copy of these important and
highly confidential instructions upon the ground as
he was breaking camp on the morning of the 12th
of September. On the same day this tell-tale document
was handed to the Federal commander. Almost
a third of Lee's army was on its way to Harper's
Ferry, many miles to the west, to seize that post,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
which McClellan thought had already been evacuated.
McClellan began to press upon the Confederates as
they retired from their advanced position to the valley
of Antietam Creek. South Mountain, a spur of the
Blue Ridge, lay between the armies. On September 16,
McClellan crossed the passes and confronted Lee, who
was now on the defensive. A most sanguinary battle
followed on the 17th, and the Confederates, having
suffered losses of nearly 12,000 men, retired to northern
Virginia. The campaign was closed, for McClellan
was too cautious to risk a second attack, and
Lee retired to a safe position south of the Potomac.
The consternation of the North subsided and President
Lincoln gave out the announcement that if
war continued till January he would emancipate the
slaves by executive order in all the States which at
that time refused to recognize the Federal authority.</p>

<p>The elections which came in October and November
following ran heavily against the Administration.
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, and Wisconsin, Republican States in
1860, went Democratic. Only in States where the
war upon the South, as the ancient enemy, was popular
did the Administration receive hearty support.
In the moderate States like Pennsylvania and the
border States like Kentucky, the Republican party
had practically ceased to exist. The Emancipation
Proclamation had served to emphasize the almost
fatal cleavage in Northern public opinion.</p>

<p>But the fortunes of both sides depended on victory
in the field as well as votes in Congress, and all eyes
turned again to the movements of Lee. The failure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
McClellan to follow Lee and deliver battle led to his
second removal from command. Ambrose E. Burnside,
a corps commander who had done good work at
Antietam, succeeded, and in obedience to the orders of
the War Department moved directly upon Richmond
by way of Fredericksburg, with an army of 122,000.
But Lee confronted him on the south bank of the
Rappahannock, and though his forces were only a
little more than half as strong, there was no uneasiness
at Confederate headquarters. On the 12th of
December Burnside crossed the Rappahannock and
attacked Lee, who held the formidable hills on the
southern bank of that stream. Another bloody battle
ensued. After a vain and hopeless sacrifice of 12,000
men, Burnside withdrew to the northern bank of
the river. The active fighting of 1862 had come to a
close. In northern Mississippi Grant and Sherman were
blocked; at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the armies of
Rosecrans and Bragg were about to make their fruitless
onsets already mentioned, and in Virginia the
Union outlook was quite as dark as it had been after
the first unfortunate trial at arms in July, 1861.
Lincoln thought of removing Grant because of the
failure of the campaign in northern Mississippi, but
gave him another opportunity; Burnside resigned a
command he had not sought, and Joseph Hooker took
up the difficult problem of beating Lee.</p>

<p>At Washington the deepest gloom prevailed. On
July 2, 1862, before the news of McClellan's failure
to capture Richmond had reached the people, a call
for 300,000 three-year men was made. Then came the
disaster of Second Manassas and the invasion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Maryland. Recruiting went on drearily during the
fall, when most signs pointed to the failure of all
the gigantic efforts to maintain the Union. The writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i>, so dear to Anglo-Saxons, had been
frequently suspended; arbitrary arrests were made
in all parts of the North, and many well-known
men were held in military and other prisons without
warrant or trial. Stanton and Seward with the approval
of the President issued orders for the seizure
of men at night, and the mysterious disappearances
of public men in places where opposition had been
shown served to warn people against displeasing their
own officers at the capital. The cost of the war had
mounted to $2,500,000 a day, while the gross receipts
of the Government were not more than $600,000 a
day. When the time came to put into force the Emancipation
Proclamation, the people were in greater
doubt than ever about the wisdom of the move,
and Secretary Seward wrote to a friend condemning
utterly this effort to raise a servile war in the South.
The letter found its way into the newspapers and
showed once more the cleavage of Northern public
opinion. The radical East approved, the nationalist
West disapproved, and business men, bankers, merchants,
and manufacturers, whom Seward best represented,
went on their indifferent ways, refusing to
lend money to the Government save on usurious
terms, and at the same time denouncing its policy of
paying debts by issuing irredeemable paper. Lincoln
had lost the confidence of the public, even of Congress;
but, as he himself said, no other man possessed
more of that confidence. An honest German mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>chant
wrote home to friends that if the North could
only exchange officers with the Confederates, the war
would be over in a few weeks. In the midst of the
depression the Secretary of the Treasury issued another
$100,000,000 of greenbacks to meet pressing
needs; and to fill up the ranks of the armies a Federal
conscript law was enacted in March, 1863, only a
little less drastic than the Confederate measure which
was said to &ldquo;rob both the cradle and the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Hooker moved half-heartedly
upon Lee. The two armies, the Union outnumbering
the Confederate more than two to one,
met in the dreary and almost impenetrable forest,
southwest of Fredericksburg, known as the Wilderness,
though the battle which followed bears the name
of Chancellorsville. For five days the bloody work
went on, with the result that Hooker retired beaten
and humiliated before his enemy. Lee and the South
had also lost their greatest general, Stonewall Jackson,
and the people of the South were feeling to the
full the disasters of war. But Lee gathered his forces
from Norfolk, Petersburg, and Richmond, every regiment
that could be spared, more than 80,000 men,
and set his face once more toward western Maryland
and Pennsylvania, where he confidently expected
to wrest a peace from the stubborn North. The Army
of the Potomac moved on interior lines toward Gettysburg,
leaving some regiments in Washington against
an emergency. The people of Pennsylvania and New
York were panic-struck; a second time the evils of
war had been transferred from Southern to Northern
territory. Great cities have not been famous for self<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>-control
and philosophy when their banks and their
rich storehouses have been threatened with ruin.
Philadelphia and New York were no exceptions to
the rule, and if it had been left to them the war
would have been brought to a close before Lee
crossed the Pennsylvania border.</p>

<p>Once more the Union commander was changed.
Upon the modest shoulders of General George Gordon
Meade fell the heavy responsibility of saving the
riches of the Middle States and the cause of the
Union, for all felt that a Confederate victory in
the heart of the North would bring the tragedy to a
close. Lee was so bold and confident that he was
hardly more cautious in the disposition of his troops
than he had been when fighting on his own soil.
Meade secured a strong position on the hills about
the since famous village of Gettysburg, and awaited
attack; he had somewhat more than 90,000 men,
who were, however, still laboring under the delusion
that Lee was invincible and that their commanders
were unequal to those of the adversary. Without
waiting for the return of his cavalry and without
trying, like Napoleon at Austerlitz, to entice the
Federals away from their fortifications, General Lee
pressed forward. On July 1 the Confederates gained
some advantage in the fighting; on the second day
they held their own; but on the third day they attempted,
somewhat after the manner of Burnside at
Fredericksburg, the impossible, and the best army
the South ever had was hopelessly beaten. About
30,000 of their brave men were dead, wounded, or
missing. Meade had not suffered so great a loss,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and he had saved the cause of his Government. After
a day of waiting the Confederate army took up its
march unmolested toward northern Virginia. While
the people of the North rejoiced at their deliverance,
the news came that Grant had captured Vicksburg
and all the 30,000 men who had defended that important
point. The Mississippi went on its way
&ldquo;unvexed to the sea,&rdquo; as Lincoln said, for New
Orleans had long since fallen and the upper river had
been cleared of all resistance. At only one point on
the long line from Washington to Vicksburg had the
Confederates held their own&mdash;Chattanooga, whence
Bragg had retreated earlier in the year and where
the next great battle was to be fought.</p>

<p>Hastily Davis ordered his available regiments to
Bragg, who held the mountain ridges south of Chattanooga.
Lee, who felt strong enough to hold Meade
in check in northern Virginia, sent away Longstreet
with his veterans. September 19, Rosecrans attacked
Bragg on his impregnable hills, and after two days
of heroic fighting and appalling losses he retired
to the city. Bragg had won a victory similar in every
respect to that which crowned Meade's efforts at Gettysburg.
Though slow, unpopular with officers and
men, and unimaginative, he soon seized the strong
points on the river above and below the city, and
Rosecrans was surrounded, besieged, for the single,
almost impassable road to Nashville and the North
would not bear the burden of necessary supplies.
If Bragg had proved watchful and alert, it would
have been only a matter of time when the Federals
would have been driven by famine to surrender.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>Mr. Gamaliel Bradford has published some extremely interesting
studies of the war-time leaders, of which, <i>Lee, the American</i>
(1912) is by far the most important, though his <i>Confederate Portraits</i>
(1914) including character sketches of most of the eminent
Southern generals, offer a great deal that is suggestive. In volume
<span class="smcap">IV</span> of Mr. Rhodes's <i>History</i> there are two chapters which treat of
the life of the people of North and South in the most interesting
manner. In addition to the more general works already cited, one

<h4>THE COLLAPSE OF THE CONFEDERACY</h4>

<p>As one looks to-day over the sources of the history
of the great Civil War, it seems plain that the responsible
spokesmen of the Confederacy should have
made overtures to the North for peace on the basis
of an indissoluble union of the warring sections in
the autumn of 1863. But the Southern leader who
proposed reunion at that time would have been
regarded as untrue to his cause or unduly timid.
Neither Jefferson Davis nor General Lee had any
thought of surrender, though from the attitude of
representatives of the United States it was plain that
an offer to return to the Union would have been met
with ample guaranties to the owners of slaves and
full amnesty to those who had brought on the war.
Alexander Stephens alone foresaw the outcome and
began now to ask for a new national convention
in which terms of restoration and permanent union
should be fixed. Stephens was, however, already out
of harmony with President Davis; and the State of
Georgia, led by Joseph E. Brown, the Governor, and
the Confederate Vice-President himself, was regarded
by loyal Southerners as recalcitrant and therefore
not authorized to propose solutions of the problem.
The cup of Southern defeat and humiliation had not
been drained to the bottom.</p>

<p>The Confederacy owed, at the end of the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>

1863, $1,221,000,000; the State Governments, the
counties and cities, probably owed as much more.
Paper money, the only medium of exchange, was fast
giving way to barter. One dollar in gold was worth
twenty dollars in Confederate currency. The monthly
wage of a common soldier was not sufficient to buy
a bushel of wheat. People who lived in the cities
converted their tiny yards into vegetable gardens;
the planters no longer produced cotton and tobacco,
but supplies for &ldquo;their people&rdquo; and for the armies.
The annual export of cotton fell from 2,000,000
bales in 1860 to less than 200,000 in 1863, and
most of this came from areas under Federal control.
The yearly returns to the planters from foreign markets
alone had fallen from the huge returns of 1860
to almost nothing in 1863, and with the disappearance
of gold, or international money, from the South,
the Governments, Confederate and State, found their
systems of taxation breaking down. Early in 1864
taxes were made payable in corn, bacon, or wheat,
not in paper money, which every one refused to accept
at face value. Planters and farmers great and
small were now required to contribute one tenth of
their crops to the Government. This would have
given to the armies an ample supply, but the railroads
were already breaking down, while wagons and
country roads were also unable to bear the unparalleled
burden. It was a difficult situation. The States
made it worse by resisting the authority of the Confederacy;
while the Confederacy was unable either
to raise money on loans or gather taxes in kind from
farmers who preferred always to pay in "lawful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
money." The Confederacy was getting into debt beyond
all chance of redemption, and the States were
likewise mortgaged to the utmost limit of their credit
before the end of the year 1864.</p>

<p>But the tax law of 1864 was only one of the burdens
under which Southerners, who had never accustomed
themselves to paying taxes in any large
way, groaned. In 1862 General Lee had urged upon
Davis a conscript law which would keep his ranks
full. Congress grudgingly enacted the required legislation,
and later more drastic laws were passed; but
the simple people who occupied the remote mountain
sections of the South and the small farmers and tenants
of the sandy ridges or piney woods responded
slowly when confronted by the officers of the law.
Thousands positively refused service in the armies
and resorted to the dense forests or swamps, where
they were fed by friends and neighbors who refused
to assist the government recruiting agents. In the
mountains of Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee
these people were so numerous that the presence
of troops was required to keep up the semblance of
obedience to law. Local warfare was the result in
many places. Unionists who had not been able to
join the armies of the United States assisted those
who refused to serve in the Confederate ranks. As
time went on thousands of deserters joined the recalcitrants
in the Southern hills, and during the last
year of the war it was a serious problem of State and
Confederate authorities what to do with these people,
who now numbered quite a hundred thousand men.</p>

<p>Resistance to tax-gatherers and to recruiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
officers, and the despondency which followed the
disasters of 1863 and the tightening of the Federal
blockade, led to dissatisfaction and even resistance
in the loyal black belts. In North Carolina a peace
movement, led by an able newspaper editor, W. W.
Holden, gained the sympathies of Governor Vance,
who had never liked Jefferson Davis nor really sympathized
with the cause of secession. In Virginia the
friends of John B. Floyd, who had been summarily
dismissed from the army for his hasty surrender of
Fort Donelson in 1862, aided by the followers of
John M. Daniel, editor of the Richmond <i>Examiner</i>,
did what they could to embarrass the Confederate
President. The Rhett influence in South Carolina
and the long-standing quarrel of Governor Brown of
Georgia with Jefferson Davis still further weakened
the arm of Confederate administration. Even William
L. Yancey, the most fiery of the secessionist leaders
of 1860, devoted all his eloquence and abilities, from
1861 to the time of his death in 1863, to attacking
the Government of his own making. And to make
matters worse, the supreme courts of North Carolina
and Georgia undertook to annul the conscript law
and other important acts of the Confederate Congress,
and thus inaugurated a war of the judges
which seriously undermined the prestige and the
morale of the Confederate Government. Confederate
officers enrolled men for the army only to have
them released by state judges supported by their
respective governors. All the influence and abilities
of Lee and Davis were required to prevent a break-down
in the spring of 1864, when the calls for more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>

troops and additional supplies were so numerous and
pressing. West Virginia was gone, Kentucky and
Missouri, too, were wholly within the Federal lines;
and most of Tennessee, half of Mississippi, and nearly
all the region beyond the great river were lost to the
Richmond Government. New Orleans and Norfolk
were once more parts of the United States, while
large strips of territory in eastern North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Florida were held in subjection
by frowning gunboats.</p>

<p>A little cotton found its way through the beleaguered
ports of Mobile, Savannah, Charleston, and
Wilmington to Europe, and brought the lucky blockade
runners and their owners rich returns. But trade
was so small and the dangers of capture were so
many that few could look with any real hope for a
return of prosperity until the war was over. Europe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
must intervene if cotton and tobacco and sugar were
to regain their kingly state. And this was the warmest
wish of the Confederate chieftains. When the battle
of Fredericksburg was fought, all the world thought
that the desired recognition would come at once.
James M. Mason, the commissioner to England, wrote
home that a large majority of the House of Commons
was willing to vote for acknowledging Southern independence,
and Charles Francis Adams, the Minister
of the United States, was of the same opinion.
Gladstone, then one of the most popular members of
the British Cabinet, and a majority of his colleagues
favored the South. Palmerston declared, when the
Emancipation Proclamation was read to him, that
Lincoln abolished slavery where he had no power to
do so and protected it where he had power to abolish
it. Of the million voters in England at least three
fourths seemed ready to vote for Southern recognition,
and all the great manufacturers, the powerful
merchants, the country gentry, and great nobles
were openly contemptuous of the cause and policy
of the North. Carlyle ridiculed the &ldquo;Yankees,&rdquo; and
Dickens made fun of Lincoln, Sumner, Chase, and
the rest. It was apparently only a matter of weeks
before Lord Palmerston would ask Parliament to
authorize him to intervene in order to stop the &ldquo;useless&rdquo;

bloodshed and slaughter of the war between the
States.</p>

<p>In France the ruling class, the bankers, the industrialists,
the higher clergy, and many of the party
of free trade supported Napoleon III in his well-known
friendliness for the South. Moreover, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Emperor was promoting a scheme to build for his
Austrian friend, Maximilian, an empire in Mexico,
where the perennial war of factions was hotly raging.
Davis might aid such a move as a consideration for
recognition, and certainly Seward was too busy with
his own troubles to intervene on behalf of an &ldquo;outworn&rdquo;
Monroe Doctrine. Slidell, the shrewd Confederate
commissioner to France, led the Emperor
to expect Southern support of his scheme, and at the
same time borrowed millions of dollars in gold from
rich Paris bankers and hurried it off to the famishing
Confederacy. No revolutionary power ever had a
fairer chance of winning its goal than did that of
Davis and Lee in the autumn of 1862 and winter
of 1863.</p>

<p>The unexpected often happens. While Charles
Francis Adams was being coldly elbowed out of the
salons of an unsympathetic English nobility, and
when Confederate bonds were selling both in London
and Paris at or near par, Secretary Chase sent
Robert J. Walker, the former Mississippi repudiator
and successful Secretary of the Treasury under Polk,
to Europe for the purpose of breaking down Confederate
credit and building up that of the United
States.</p>

<p>The commissioner of the Treasury Department
began the publication of a series of articles on the
financial page of the London <i>Times</i> which seemed
to show that Davis had been responsible for the repudiation
of a large issue of state bonds, many of
them held in London, in 1843. All that Mason and
Slidell could do did not remove the suspicion that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>

the Confederate President would &ldquo;repudiate&rdquo; again.
Men who had loaned large sums of money to Mississippi
could not be made to understand that Walker
himself had been the responsible agent of Mississippi
in those days. From the beginning of this unpleasant
advertising of former American financiering, in
which Northern States had sinned quite as flagrantly
as Southern, Confederate credit in Europe declined.
Her bonds were soon withdrawn from the market.
At the same time Walker succeeded in borrowing
$250,000,000 from European bankers, and thus at
a critical period he was able to prop the declining
fortunes of his country. To say that Walker destroyed
the credit of the Confederacy and at the
same time restored that of the Union would be an
exaggeration. But his services were of incalculable
value to the nationalist cause. When, therefore,
Napoleon asked England to join him in intervening
between the warring parties of the United States
there was other reason, besides the strong and vigorous
activity of Charles Francis Adams, for the British
Ministry to postpone or decline co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>Thus the bright Confederate outlook of 1862 had
become dark in May, 1864, when General Grant,
who had been brought from the field of his brilliant
operations in the West, took command of the army
with which Meade had expelled Lee from Pennsylvania.
But conditions were not encouraging in the
North. Lincoln's popularity was still in eclipse.
Congress was resentful of his failures. Charles Sumner
was denouncing him every day in private and
opposing him in public. Secretary Chase was using<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the machinery of his great office to deprive his chief
of a renomination. The radicals of the East were
still refusing their approval of a policy which compromised
with slavery in the border States, and the
Unionists of the Northwest were resentful toward a
President who was making war upon slavery. The
Democrats of the North were apparently stronger
than ever, and their criticism of the Government for
suspending the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and for hundreds
of arbitrary arrests gave conservative men
pause. To all this must be added the resistance in
1863 to the military drafts, the riots, the extraordinary
prosperity of business men which made recruiting,
even with the aid of laws almost as drastic as
those of the South, almost impossible. The cost in
bounties to nation, state, and counties of one enlistment
in 1864 was about $1000; and when a regiment
was thus made up, a third of the men sometimes
deserted within a few months and re&euml;nlisted under
other names, thus securing a second or a third series
of bounties.</p>

<p>Still the success of the Northern cause seemed to
depend on the renomination of Lincoln, for any
other Republican Unionist would certainly be defeated
by the Democrats, who were fast uniting
upon General McClellan, exceedingly popular with
both War Democrats and those who had opposed
the war from the beginning. If the outlook in the
South was discouraging, that of the North was almost
as depressing.</p>

<p>With public opinion keen, critical, and watchful,
the great duel reopened in Virginia and Georgia in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
May, 1864. Grant attacked with an army of 120,000
men; Lee returned the blow with a force of
about 60,000 seasoned and resolute soldiers. From
May 3 to June 12 the two great generals fought over
the tangled thickets and sandy ridges which extend
from the Wilderness to Cold Harbor near Richmond,
where McClellan had failed in 1862. Grant failed
in every attempt to defeat his foe, and he lost in
that short period about 54,000 brave men&mdash;an
army almost equal in numbers to that which they opposed.
The people and the papers of the North were
demanding the removal of their last general; United
States bonds and paper money were a drug on the
stock market; it was reported that Grant was drinking
deeply. Lincoln knew that to remove his general
would be tantamount to surrender, for B. F.
Butler, then on the lower James, would be the only
and last resort, and Lee would make short work
of that remarkable commander. There was a little
encouragement in the fighting of Sherman against
Joseph E. Johnston, who was yielding more and
more of northern Georgia to his rival. But June
and July, 1864, were the darkest hours of the Union
cause and of Lincoln, its champion.</p>

<p>Lee now felt himself secure in his position near
Malvern Hill, and expected daily to hear of the removal
of his antagonist. But Grant, to the surprise
of all, performed the greatest feat of his military
career by safely placing all his army, still 120,000
strong, on the south side of the James River, where
there were no intrenchments and no other obstacles
to their marching upon Petersburg, the key to Rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>mond.
This was done with incredible facility, June
16, 17, and 18, while Lee quietly waited for the
enemy to attack him once more. While Lee thus
rested on his arms, Grant carried his army through
the open country east of Petersburg. Too late, June
18, the Confederate commander hastened all his
forces to the new scene of war. Grant had played
an incomparable ruse, and the Union army entered,
with returning faith in its leader, upon the last phase
of its great task&mdash;the ruin of Lee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Sherman, with a force of 80,000,
had been driving Joseph E. Johnston, with
50,000 men, from Dalton in northern Georgia
toward Atlanta. From May 4 until July 18 the two
armies maneuvered and fought&mdash;each seeking without
success to surprise the other. On the 17th of
July Sherman crossed the Chattahoochee some
twenty miles north of Atlanta. Georgia and the
cotton belt of the lower South were in a panic.
Davis, never quite satisfied with Johnston's operations,
yielded to the clamors of Senators and Representatives,
as well as military men, and removed
the general. John B. Hood, the new commander,
began at once a series of battles around the doomed
city, losing in every encounter. Atlanta fell on
September 2. Sherman was left in quiet possession
of northern Georgia, while the Confederate army
marched toward Nashville in the hope of forcing a
retreat and perhaps of regaining Tennessee. With
Grant at Petersburg, whose fall would compel the
evacuation of Richmond, and Sherman the master
of Georgia, for such was the meaning of Hood's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>

movements, the days of the Confederacy seemed to
be numbered.</p>

<p>Before these military successes had been gained,
the leaders of the Union cause were compelled to
nominate a candidate for the Presidency. Sumner,
Greeley, William Cullen Bryant, and many other
men of great influence opposed Lincoln's renomination.
A convention of radical Republicans met at
Cleveland during the last days of May. It nominated
John C. Fr&eacute;mont for President. But the regular
Republican Convention met a week later in
Baltimore, formally disavowed its name, and assumed
that of the National Union party. Its chairman
was Robert J. Breckinridge, a Kentucky
preacher and Unionist. Lincoln was renominated
without opposition, and, as a bid to the border
States, Andrew Johnson, Union Democrat of Tennessee,
was nominated for Vice-President. However,
the reverses of Grant in Virginia weakened the position
of the Administration, and before the 1st of
August trusted advisers of the Government telegraphed
&ldquo;The apathy of the public mind is fearful.&rdquo;
The price of gold ranged during the summer
from 200 to 285, and United States securities sold
at less than half their face value. The President
was compelled to order a draft of 500,000 men in
July; the country met the order with a groan. Congress
asked for the appointment of a day of fasting
and penance, and Lincoln set the first Thursday in
August as a &ldquo;day of national humiliation and prayer.&rdquo;
So portentous was the outlook that before the middle
of August most of the eminent men in the Union<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
party had lost all heart. Greeley wrote, &ldquo;Lincoln is
already beaten.&rdquo; A committee waited on the President
to ask his formal withdrawal from the canvass.</p>

<p>Late in August, when the Unionist hopes were at
their lowest, the Democrats met in Chicago. Governor
Seymour, of New York, Representatives Pendleton,
of Ohio, Voorhees, of Indiana, and the unpopular
Clement L. Vallandigham were in charge of
the proceedings. Southern leaders came over from
Canada and even representatives of the Sons of
Liberty, a group of Northwesterners who were resisting
the National Administration, were participants
in the convention. Vallandigham, a &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo;
man, secured the passage of a resolution
which declared the war a failure, but the War Democrats
dictated the nomination and made George B.
McClellan the candidate of the party. The general,
who had fought some of the great battles of the
war, repudiated the Vallandigham resolution, but accepted
the proffered leadership. On the day the convention
adjourned it seemed clear to the thoughtful
men of the country that the Democrats would win
the election, and that they would in that event bring
the war to a close by acknowledging Southern independence.</p>

<p>But before the delegates had reached their homes,
the telegraph announced the fall of Atlanta. Commodore
Farragut had just taken Mobile after a long
and heroic struggle. President Lincoln, a masterful
manipulator of popular opinion, now called upon the
country to assemble in their churches and give thanks
to God for the splendid victories of Sherman and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Farragut. Early in September General Phil Sheridan
invaded the Shenandoah Valley, made famous
by Jackson in the beginning of the war, and won a
decisive victory at Winchester. Before the end of
the month he had burned thousands of barns, slaughtered
many thousands of cattle, and destroyed the
newly harvested grain in all that rich region. His
terse remark that a crow could not cross the Valley
without taking with him his provisions received widespread
applause, and showed what a desperate character
the war had taken. Sherman, too, took up his
march through the rich black belt of Georgia, destroying
everything that came within his reach. The
people of the North took heart, especially the stiff-backed
Republicans who during the two years preceding
had found little to approve in the measures
of the Government. Sumner, who had called Lincoln
the American Louis XVI; Thaddeus Stevens, who
had declared that he knew only one Lincoln man in
the House of Representatives; Horace Greeley, Secretary
Chase, and even Governor Andrew of Massachusetts,
all united now to praise the President and
urge his cause before the country. The last great
crisis of the war in the North had been passed. A
decisive victory at the polls was the verdict of the
people, and the homely, honest, and kindly Lincoln
was commissioned to bring the war to a conclusion
and then to reconstruct the Union.</p>

<p>The South observed movements in the North now
with hopeful, now with regretful, scrutiny. As a desperate
stroke Davis had sent Jacob Thompson to
Canada to assist in the release of Confederate pris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>oners
and to stir up the Sons of Liberty to rise
against the Federal Government. In October raiding
parties were sent into New England, and an effort
was made to set fire to New York City in retaliation
for the destruction of Southern property by order
of Federal generals. These efforts proved abortive,
perhaps adding many votes to the majority with
which Lincoln was re&euml;lected. And when the Confederate
Congress reassembled in November the fortunes
of the South were recognized as almost past
remedy. Georgia did not rise to overwhelm Sherman;
the supplies painfully collected in thousands of

<i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts</i> could not be carried to Lee's army in Petersburg;
the railroads were almost useless, and starvation
confronted those who lived in the larger towns.
Only a great and overwhelming victory over Grant
could save the South, and that seemed impossible
when thousands of Confederate soldiers had deserted
their standards. With 40,000 men it was not likely
that Lee could raise the siege of Petersburg or
capture any large part of Grant's army of nearly
140,000.</p>

<p>In the hope of filling the thin ranks of the Southern
armies, President Davis recommended to Congress
the enlistment of the blacks; and to secure
foreign recognition, he sent Duncan F. Kenner to
Europe to offer emancipation of the slaves. But
Congress regarded these moves with ill-concealed
contempt and offered counter-solutions. Alexander
Stephens, the Vice-President, led a movement to impeach
Davis. Powerful influences in Virginia supported
Stephens; in North Carolina, opposition to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the Confederate authorities had been carried so far
that such a proposal was regarded with approval.
The Rhett party in South Carolina and the Joseph
E. Brown following in Georgia were all ready to follow
Stephens. A large section of public opinion had
in fact been prepared in all these States for such a
plan. A committee of Congress was formed and William
C. Rives was sent to General Lee to inquire if
he would take charge of the affairs of the Confederacy
as sole dictator. Lee declined the dubious honor,
and Congress, not knowing what else to do, undertook
in early January, 1865, to carry out the recommendations
of the President.</p>

<p>By the end of December, 1864, General Sherman
had captured Savannah, and was ready to begin his
march northward to support Grant. On the suggestion
of Montgomery Blair, father of Postmaster-General
Blair, a conference was arranged with the Federal
authorities, to take place on a United States steamer
in Hampton Roads. Lincoln and Seward thus met,
on February 3, Alexander Stephens, former United
States Judge Campbell, and Senator R. M. T.
Hunter, all identified with the Confederate peace
party. Satisfactory terms could not be agreed upon
and the renewal of the conflict was ordered. As the
commissioners passed through the lines, the news of
their failure was conveyed to both armies, and these
brave soldiers of many campaigns, having long since
learned to respect each other, wept aloud. The failure
of these negotiations confirmed Davis in his position
and he now made one more appeal to the people
of the South to save their cause by a popular upris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>ing.
Stephens and the rest lent their support to the
call; but it was all in vain, for the sands of the Confederacy
were almost run. General Sherman with
60,000 men was marching through South Carolina.
Columbia was laid in ashes on the night of February
17, and the naked chimneys of the cotton belt
from Atlanta to middle South Carolina marked the
course of the Federal army. The people of North
Carolina trembled at the approach of the victorious
enemy. Joseph E. Johnston was finally restored to
the command of the remnants of his former army
and the local militia which undertook to delay the
progress of the Federal forces. Well-to-do families
fled to places of refuge; horses and cattle were driven
to the best hiding-places that could be found; the
silver plate and the little gold that remained among
the people were buried under woodpiles or deserted
houses. The negroes awaited with stolid curiosity the
approach of the &ldquo;Yankees,&rdquo; who were by this time
vaguely recognized as the &ldquo;deliverers&rdquo;; while the
poor whites were thankful that their poverty for once
proved a blessing.</p>

<p>In February the Confederate Congress offered a
certain number of slaves their liberty on condition
of their fighting for Southern independence; but it
was too late for any test of the radical policy. The
new commissioner to Europe had hardly reached
London before the collapse of his Government was
seen to be imminent. The debts of the Confederate,
state, and city governments of the South had grown
so rapidly that no one knew just what they were;
the armies of Lee and Johnston were forced to forage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
upon the country nearest at hand. Soldiers were
barefoot, half-naked, and dispirited. Grant pressed
steadily upon Lee at Petersburg, Sheridan approached
Lee's rear from Lynchburg, Virginia, and B. F. Butler,
with 40,000 men, threatened Richmond from the
lower James River. To escape the toils of the enemy,
Lee decided to retreat toward the west. Jefferson
Davis received the dispatch which told of Lee's new
purpose and advised the evacuation of the capital
about noon on April 2. It was Sunday, and the people
were at church. Rapidly the fateful news spread.
An indescribable scene followed. Men, women, and
children hastened out of the doomed city with the
little clothing they could carry in their hands, or
begged the owners of carts and wagons to come to
their assistance. Thousands thus sought to escape
the avenger, while the high officials of the Government
and their families went away on the last train.
Documents, private correspondence, stores of all sorts,
tobacco, and other property were burned to prevent
their falling into the hands of the hated enemy.
Early Monday morning the city was deserted save
by certain hangers-on, men and women, white and
black, who hoped to pick up something from the
wreckage of their neighbors' fortunes. The local government
ordered the thousands of barrels of whiskey,
still in the bar-rooms, emptied into the streets. People
drank from the gutters, and drunkenness soon
added to the difficulties of the situation. Federal
troops entered the city, already in flames, and before
nine o'clock the Union colors flew from the flagpole
of the ancient capital of Virginia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>Davis and his Cabinet escaped to Danville, Virginia,
where they remained until the news of Lee's surrender
at Appomattox reached them on April 10,
when they retreated toward Charlotte, North Carolina.
Lee had seen the inevitable, and on April 9,
near the little village of Appomattox, he asked
Grant for terms. The Union commander was generous,
and allowed the 28,000 heroic Confederates to
return to their homes, giving only their word of
honor that they would keep the peace in the future.
A few days later near Durham, North Carolina,
Johnston surrendered to Sherman on similar terms
to those which Grant had given Lee. The President
and members of the defunct government of the Confederate
States of America hastened on to Georgia,
where Davis was captured on May 10 and sent to
Fortress Monroe as a state prisoner. Other forces of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>

the South, scattered over the wide area of their desolate
country, surrendered during the month of May;
and most people turned to cultivation of their crops in
the hope that a bountiful nature might restore somewhat
their broken fortunes. The bitter cup had been
drained. The cause of the planters had gone down
in irretrievable disaster. For forty years they had
contended with their rivals of the North, and having
staked all on the wager of battle they had lost. Just
four years before they had entered with unsurpassed
zeal and enthusiasm upon the gigantic task of winning
their independence. They had made the greatest
fight in history up to that time, lost the flower of
their manhood and wealth untold. They now renewed
once and for all time their allegiance to the Union
which had up to that time been an experiment, a
government of uncertain powers. More than three
hundred thousand lives and not less than four billions
of dollars had been sacrificed in the fight of the
South. The planter culture, the semi-feudalism of the
&ldquo;old South,&rdquo; was annihilated, while the industrial
and financial system of the East was triumphant.
The cost to the North had been six hundred thousand
lives and an expense to the governments, state
and national, of at least five billion dollars. But the
East was the mistress of the United States, and the
social and economic ideals of that section were to be
stamped permanently upon the country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</p>

<p>J. K. Hosmer, <i>The Outcome of the Civil War</i> (1900), in <i>American
Nation</i> Series; J. A. Woodburn, <i>The Life of Thaddeus Stevens</i>

(1913); E. P. Oberholtzer, <i>Jay Cooke, Financier of the Civil War</i>
(1907); J. C. Schwab, <i>The Confederate States, A Financial and Industrial
History</i> (1901); E. D. Fite, <i>Social and Industrial Conditions
in the North During the Civil War</i> (1910), W. F. Fox, <i>Regimental
Losses in the American Civil War</i> (1889).</p>

<p>Of special sectional value is W. D. Foulke's <i>The Life of Oliver
P. Morton</i> (1899). Henry Wilson's <i>The Rise and Fall of the Slave
Power</i> (1872-77); A. H. Stephens's <i>A Constitutional View of the
Late War Between the States</i> (1868-70) are typical of many others.
Some of the best writers on the life and ideals of the old South are
Mrs. Roger A. Pryor, <i>Reminiscences of Peace and War</i> (1906), and

<i>My Day</i> (1911); Mrs. James Chesnut, <i>A Diary from Dixie</i> (1905);
Mrs. Clement C. Clay, <i>A Belle of the Sixties</i> (1904); and Mrs.
Myrta L. Avery, <i>Dixie after the War</i> (1906). Mrs. Jefferson Davis's
<i>A Memoir of Jefferson Davis</i> (1890) is rather personal and profuse,
but always more important than the more pretentious work of her
husband, Jefferson Davis, in his <i>Rise and Fall of the Confederate
Government</i>, already mentioned.</p>

<p>A rare source book for the South is J. B. Jones's <i>A Rebel War
Clerk's Diary</i> (1866), and an even more important one for the
North is Gideon Welles's <i>Diary</i> (1911). Edward McPherson's
<i>Political History of the United States During the Great Rebellion</i>
(1865); William McDonald's <i>Select Statutes and Other Documents
Illustrative of the History of the United States, 1861-98</i> (1903); J. D.
Richardson's <i>Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Confederacy</i>
(1905); and <i>Appleton's Annual Cyclopedia and Register,
1862-1903</i>, give the most important official documents and full
accounts of public events as they occurred.</p>
